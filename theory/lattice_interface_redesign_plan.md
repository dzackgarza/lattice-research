# Lattice Interface Complete Redesign Plan

This file is the execution plan for the complete lattice redesign. It
supersedes the earlier lightweight plan draft.

## Overview

Current state is not acceptable because the public lattice layer still carries
wrong semantics from an ambient embedded-module model, stale naming, thin
wrapper helpers, and incomplete morphism/group structure. The target state is a
clean semantic hierarchy of public nouns whose implementations delegate exact
computation to Sage and the existing backend code without leaking backend
concepts into the public API.

This is a complete redesign of the lattice interface, not a compatibility
cleanup. The current generated code is retained only as migration source
material. Any concept rejected in the canonical specs must be excised rather
than preserved behind shims or transitional wrappers.

## Canonical Sources

- `theory/spec_backups/lattices_written_spec_backup.py`
- `theory/lattice_redesign_corrections_spec.md`

These two files are the source of truth for architecture, naming, and semantic
requirements. Existing tests, current implementation details, and temporary
adapter code are not source-of-truth artifacts.

## Constraints

- No compatibility shims.
- No legacy import aliases beyond the final intended public export surface.
- No public `native` terminology.
- No public `to_sage`, `from_sage`, or equivalent Sage-object extraction or
  admission on the final public surface.
- No ambient embedding state on public lattice/module nouns.
- No helper wrappers for trivial one-line Sage operations.
- No new public methods that merely expose Sage-native semantics rejected by the
  specs.
- No `raise`, `try` / `except`, or `None`-sentinel control flow in final
  mathematical APIs.
- No hand-rolled public validation in constructors or conversion entry points;
  public-boundary validation must live in pydantic models.
- No optional arguments or optional public field types in the final API unless
  the user explicitly approves them.
- No `Any`, `object`, or similarly broad public type annotations.
- No manual matrix-equation checks duplicated across call sites when semantic
  containment on the relevant noun should own that check.
- No internal renaming of semantically obvious canonical objects.
- No further redesign work should add features to the current flat files except
  insofar as they are being migrated or deleted.
- Existing generated code must be migrated and reused where mathematically sound
  rather than discarded wholesale.
- General verbs must live on the highest semantically valid noun; do not push
  broadly meaningful operations down into lattice-only subclasses when they make
  sense for `BilinearModule`, its morphisms, or its hom spaces.
- Morphisms are hom-space elements, not containers or ambient subobjects.

## Preconditions

- The two canonical spec files above remain readable and tracked.
- The current generated lattice code remains available as extraction source
  until its logic has been migrated into the target hierarchy.
- Pydantic is the required public-boundary validation layer for constructor and
  coercion inputs.
- Mathematical preconditions inside proved algorithms remain assertions; object
  shape validation does not.
- The final public nouns must provide the standard method surface required by
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`: `__hash__`, `__repr__`, correct `__eq__`, and LaTeX
  printing hooks.

## Scope

In scope:

- Replacing the current lattice public API hierarchy.
- Replacing the current file layout with a real subdirectory hierarchy.
- Rebuilding morphisms, homspaces, dual/discriminant semantics, and orthogonal
  group semantics to match the written specs.
- Moving backend delegation behind the new semantic layer.
- Deleting rejected concepts and stale names from the public surface.

Out of scope during the redesign:

- Preserving the old API shape merely to keep stale tests passing.
- Expanding unrelated mathematical features.
- Full-suite stabilization before the new hierarchy is in place.

## Target Hierarchy

The public package should end in this form:

- `src/lattices/__init__.py`: final public exports only
- `src/lattices/core/abstract.py`: concrete `BilinearModule` wrapping an FGP
  module together with a bilinear form matrix in a fixed generator order,
  bilinear-form wrapper nouns, quadratic-module layer
- `src/lattices/core/elements.py`: element nouns and shared element behavior
- `src/lattices/core/free.py`: free bilinear-module semantics over general `R`
- `src/lattices/core/torsion.py`: pure-torsion specialization of the general
  bilinear-module noun
- `src/lattices/core/rational.py`: `RationalLattice`, `DualLattice`
- `src/lattices/core/integral.py`: `Lattice`
- `src/lattices/core/discriminant.py`: `DiscriminantForm`,
  `DiscriminantGroup`, discriminant elements
- `src/lattices/morphisms/homspaces.py`: homspace nouns
- `src/lattices/morphisms/lattice.py`: rational/integral lattice morphisms
- `src/lattices/morphisms/discriminant.py`: discriminant morphisms
- `src/lattices/groups/orthogonal.py`: orthogonal-group nouns and subgroup
  semantics
- `src/lattices/validation/presentations.py`: constructor validation only

Backend delegation should end in this form:

- `src/backends/isometry_backend.py`: isometry delegation only
- `src/backends/dawes_orbit_backend.py`: orbit/stabilizer delegation only
- `src/backends/isotropic_gamma_orbit_backend.py`: isotropic-orbit delegation
  only

Flat files such as the current `src/lattices/modules.py`,
`src/lattices/morphisms.py`, `src/lattices/groups.py`, and
`src/lattices/orthogonal.py` are temporary migration waypoints and should be
deleted once their contents have been moved into the target hierarchy.

## Phases

### Phase A: Containment and skeleton

- Create the target subdirectory hierarchy and stub only the intended files.
- Freeze the public noun vocabulary and file ownership.
- Mark current flat lattice files as migration-source files, not destinations.
- Completion:
  - every target file exists,
  - every public noun has a declared home,
  - no new work lands in the wrong file class.
- Verification:
  - file inventory inspection,
  - import graph inspection,
  - diff review confirming no new compatibility shims were added.

### Phase B: Core noun migration

- Replace the current abstract-shell top layer with a real semantic carrier:
  `BilinearModule` must wrap a finitely generated module presented as an FGP
  module together with a bilinear form matrix in a fixed generator order.
- `FreeBilinearModule` and `TorsionBilinearModule` are specializations of that
  general noun when the torsion part or free part vanishes, respectively.
- Keep bilinear and quadratic public semantics distinct even when a class stores
  multiple Sage backend objects for delegation.
- Move shared element semantics, free-module semantics, and
  rational/integral lattice semantics into the target `core/` files.
- Replace hard-coded `ZZ` where the written spec requires general `R`.
- Remove rejected public state:
  `ambient_parent`, `inclusion_matrix`, `projection_lattice`,
  `projection_matrix`, `scaled_element`, `lift_vector`, and any public
  `native`-style methods.
- Lift general module verbs upward so they live on `BilinearModule` unless they
  truly require lattice-specific structure: `gens`, `element_from`, direct
  sums, twists, submodule generation, quotient construction, bilinear-form
  access, and related parent-level operations.
- Remove public Sage leakage:
  `to_sage`, `from_sage`, direct Sage-object constructor admission, and
  analogous passthroughs that let callers bypass the semantic layer.
- Remove optional-argument constructor shapes from the public nouns and split
  the cases into explicit constructors or class methods.
- Completion:
  - `BilinearModule(...)` is a concrete mixed free-plus-torsion noun backed by
    an FGP module and a bilinear form matrix,
  - `FreeBilinearModule` and `TorsionBilinearModule` are genuine special cases
    of that noun rather than disjoint presentation systems,
  - public module/lattice nouns are presented only by generators and Gram data,
  - membership is parent-based,
  - no ambient embedding state remains on the public nouns,
  - no public Sage leakage remains on the noun surface.
- Verification:
  - direct inspection of public constructors and fields,
  - import compile of the moved files,
  - spec-review against the canonical sources,
  - grep confirming that public `src/lattices/core/` APIs no longer expose
    `to_sage`, `from_sage`, `ambient_parent`, or `inclusion_matrix`.

### Phase C: Validation and typing pass

- Replace hand-written public validation with explicit pydantic models at the
  public boundary.
- Add complete type annotations on constructors, element conversions, morphism
  constructors, and group entry points.
- Replace `hasattr`/`isinstance` abuse with typed or semantic dispatch.
- Remove `raise`-style validation from public constructors and coercions.
- Remove optional public types and `Any`-typed surfaces from the final lattice
  package.
- Add explicit `@override` markers wherever the codebase/runtime supports them.
- Completion:
  - public constructors and coercions validate through pydantic models,
  - abstract classes have real abstract methods,
  - public methods no longer return `None` for mathematically undefined cases,
  - public mathematical APIs use assertions only for true mathematical domain
    obligations rather than input-shape checking,
  - public signatures avoid `Any` and optional variants.
- Verification:
  - static inspection of signatures,
  - direct inspection of validation ownership in `src/lattices/validation/`,
  - import compile,
  - grep confirming no new `raise`, `try`, or `except` in the public lattice
    layer,
  - grep confirming no `Any`, `object`, `| None`, or `Optional` in the public
    lattice signatures.

### Phase D: Morphisms and homspaces

- Rebuild homspace nouns first, then morphism elements as elements of those
  spaces, wrapping Sage homsets and morphisms rather than hand-rolling matrix
  carriers.
- Use Sage's real parent hook: custom hom construction belongs on `_Hom_`,
  not on ad hoc `Hom` forwarding methods.
- Custom homsets must be initialized with the bilinear-module category itself;
  passing the homset category in directly produces the wrong Sage construction
  path.
- Wrapped module/lattice/discriminant elements must be genuine Sage
  `Element`/`ElementWrapper` instances; plain Python wrappers break
  `Map.__call__`, coercion, and category-owned morphism behavior.
- Implement the missing constructor families and migration of existing matrix
  and generator-image logic.
- Replace the current bogus cokernel logic with actual bilinear-module quotient
  construction driven by the FGP module cokernel.
- On torsion/discriminant backends, build homomorphisms through the backend's
  own Smith-form constructor (`_hom_from_smith`) when that is the exact Sage
  interface, rather than reassembling maps through ad hoc image routing.
- Move matrix-isometry checking to the semantic containment boundary of the
  relevant hom-space or orthogonal-group noun instead of repeating matrix
  equations in ad hoc methods.
- Delete wrong-noun APIs from morphisms: no morphism `__contains__`, no
  morphism `perp`, and no ambient-subobject semantics on morphism elements.
- Lift general morphism verbs upward so they live on
  `BilinearModuleMorphism` unless they genuinely require integral/rational
  specialization: `image`, `kernel`, `cokernel`, `is_primitive`, and the
  standard constructors through hom-space parents.
- Completion:
  - `hom()` returns homspaces,
  - morphisms own `image`, `kernel`, `cokernel`, `is_primitive`, and related
    verbs,
  - `A_L := coker(L -> L^*)` is modeled through the correct construction path,
  - equality on hom spaces and morphisms matches the `CONTRIBUTING.md`
    semantics.
- Verification:
  - API inspection,
  - dedicated spec tests once the hierarchy is stable,
  - review against the morphism block in the written spec backup.

### Phase E: Discriminant and dual semantics

- Rebuild `DualLattice` and discriminant objects without fake projection state.
- Ensure dual-lattice elements, not ad hoc vectors, are the relevant lift
  objects.
- Move lattice invariants such as `delta` and `coparity` to the lattice layer.
- Completion:
  - discriminant class semantics come from the dual/discriminant architecture,
    not from remembered ambient state,
  - discriminant-group API does not own lattice-only invariants.
- Verification:
  - public API inspection,
  - direct comparison against the preserved correction spec.

### Phase F: Orthogonal groups and backend boundary

- Move orthogonal-group nouns into `src/lattices/groups/orthogonal.py`.
- Remove constraint-merge bookkeeping from the public group layer and express
  subgroup semantics through the proper `ConditionSet` boundary.
- Keep backend files delegation-only; they may compute generators/orbits, but
  they must not define the public semantics.
- Completion:
  - `L.orthogonal_group()` is the semantic home,
  - stabilizers live on the orthogonal-group nouns,
  - backend files no longer dictate public API structure.
- Verification:
  - call-site inspection,
  - import compile,
  - spec-check against the orthogonal-group corrections.

### Phase G: Debris deletion

- Delete temporary flat files and any remaining stale names once all migrated
  logic has a final home.
- Delete rejected helper functions and old shim names.
- Delete internal renamings of canonical objects where direct construction is
  the intended name.
- Completion:
  - the repo has exactly one intended public lattice hierarchy,
  - no duplicate or transitional lattice files remain.
- Verification:
  - file inventory,
  - grep for banned names and rejected fields.

## Current Status Snapshot

This section records the actual redesign state after the `_Hom_` /
`ElementWrapper` migration slice and after comparison against
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, the lattice spec tests, and the durable lattice memories.
It is the current signoff surface for what remains architecturally unresolved.

### What is materially in place

- The target subdirectory hierarchy from Phase A exists.
- The canonical public module `src/lattices/lattices.py` has been restored as
  the intended semantic export surface after it was accidentally blanked by QC
  tooling.
- The bilinear-module category now uses Sage's real `_Hom_` hook rather than
  ad hoc `Hom` forwarding.
- Bilinear-module and discriminant elements are now real Sage
  `ElementWrapper`-based elements, which fixes the previous `Map.__call__`
  failure mode.
- Bilinear homsets/morphisms and discriminant homsets/morphisms now wrap Sage
  hom objects instead of pretending plain Python wrappers are sufficient.
- Homspace selection is now stratified by semantic layer rather than always
  collapsing to the generic bilinear homspace:
  - lattice-to-lattice homs produce lattice morphisms;
  - rational-lattice homs produce rational-lattice morphisms;
  - discriminant-group homs use their own discriminant homspace.
- Direct sums now install their canonical summands and embedding morphisms on
  the ambient result instead of throwing away that decomposition immediately.
- Free torsionfree bilinear modules now use explicit Sage `FGP_Module`
  backends, which makes mixed-ring hom construction behave predictably instead
  of collapsing onto quotient-vector-space edge cases.
- `DualLattice` is now modeled as a free `ZZ`-module with `QQ`-valued form,
  rather than as a raw `QQ`-vector-space lattice.
  This restores the intended semantics of the inclusion
  `\iota_L : L \to L^*`:
  - unimodular inclusions are surjective,
  - non-unimodular inclusions have torsion cokernel,
  - `coker(\iota_L)` can now be promoted to `DiscriminantGroup`.
- The discriminant-hom path now handles both nontrivial Smith-form data and the
  trivial discriminant-group endomorphism case without falling back to the
  wrong Sage homset category.
- Morphisms now expose the missing spec-facing verbs needed by the redesign
  slice:
  - `is_injective`, `is_surjective`, `is_bijective`, `is_isomorphism`,
    `is_isometry`,
  - `direct_sum`,
  - `perp` on subobject embeddings.
- A manual runtime sweep of the current written-feedback spec surface now
  passes end to end without running the global QC/lint stack.
- The correction artifacts already record the two critical Sage-integration
  lessons from this slice:
  - custom hom construction belongs on `_Hom_`;
  - wrapped elements must be genuine Sage elements.

### Framing corrections carried into this plan

The user corrected the execution framing in April 2026, and this plan must
preserve those corrections explicitly:

- The spec is the contract for this redesign.
  Files under `tests/lattice_spec/` and the relevant lattice/module files under
  `tests/sage_spec/` are normative until the user says otherwise.
- Unimplemented spec surface is remaining required work.
  It is not "aspirational", not optional migration material, and not an
  external obstacle category separate from the work itself.
- Intermediate redesign slices are not task completion.
  This plan must not declare success while required spec surface remains
  unimplemented.

### Current remaining required work

The redesign stop condition is not yet met because required spec work remains.
The items below are unfinished implementation, not polish:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` still forbids optional/default public APIs, but the live
  lattice surface still exposes them in files such as
  `src/lattices/core/free.py`,
  `src/lattices/core/rational.py`,
  `src/lattices/core/integral.py`,
  `src/lattices/core/discriminant.py`,
  `src/lattices/groups/orthogonal.py`,
  `src/lattices/morphisms/discriminant.py`,
  `src/lattices/morphisms/homspaces.py`, and
  `src/lattices/categories/bilinear_modules.py`.
  These are not style nits; they violate the stated public API contract.
- Backend encapsulation is still incomplete.
  Public-path lattice/discriminant/group code still depends on
  `_sage_like` / `_from_sage_like`, and discriminant comparison still reaches
  into Sage-private data such as `_modulus` / `_modulus_qf`.
  That remains architectural leakage under `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- The general module-theory surface required by `tests/sage_spec/misc.sage`
  remains to be implemented on the noun layer:
  free/torsion decomposition, tensor/base-change/localization/completion,
  richer `Hom`/`End`/`Aut` support, kernels/cokernels/projections/natural maps,
  and the stated `Tor`/`Ext`-adjacent module semantics.
- The root/Weyl/Coxeter/Eichler surface required by
  `tests/lattice_spec/interface_extensions.sage` and
  `tests/sage_spec/coxeter.sage` remains to be implemented:
  root systems, root sublattices, Weyl groups, Coxeter diagrams, reflections,
  reflection decompositions, Eichler groups, and the associated diagram/group
  morphism surface.
- The discriminant and subobject enrichment required by
  `tests/lattice_spec/interface_extensions.sage` and
  `tests/lattice_spec/more_specs.sage` remains to be implemented:
  isotropic-element enumerators, norm-class partitions, value maps,
  saturated-image/submodule semantics, and the richer quotient/cokernel
  behavior required by the written spec.
- The witness/functionals and dual-surface API required by
  `tests/lattice_spec/more_specs.sage` remains to be implemented:
  witness-returning isometry checks, the exact functional/homspace constructor
  surface, and the remaining dual/discriminant lift behavior.
- The canonical-construction gap is still open.
  `tests/lattice_spec/interface_semantics.sage` and
  `tests/lattice_spec/todo_general_indefinite_isometry_spec.py` still need raw
  `IntegralLattice`, `ambient_module()`, and basis-surgery constructions for
  some cases, which means the noun surface is still missing required canonical
  constructors or exact transforms.
- The plan artifact itself was previously corrupted by a false completion
  declaration.
  Until this list is kept in sync with the real code/spec state, this
  file is not a reliable signoff surface.

### Immediate redesign order

The next implementation slices should proceed in this order:

- remove optional/default/`None`-shaped public API surfaces until the noun
  layer conforms to `CONTRIBUTING.md`;
- reduce public-path Sage leakage, keeping backend interop private instead of
  admitting or comparing raw Sage objects through noun methods;
- implement the general module-theory surface required by
  `tests/sage_spec/misc.sage`;
- implement the root/Weyl/Coxeter/Eichler surface required by
  `tests/lattice_spec/interface_extensions.sage` and
  `tests/sage_spec/coxeter.sage`;
- implement the discriminant/subobject enrichment and witness/functionals
  surface required by `tests/lattice_spec/interface_extensions.sage` and
  `tests/lattice_spec/more_specs.sage`;
- extend the noun surface so the remaining spec cases stop depending on raw
  `IntegralLattice`, `ambient_module()`, and basis-surgery setup;
- only after the required spec surface is implemented may this file grow a
  completion section again.

### Stop condition

The redesign is complete only when all of the following are true:

- the public noun surface no longer violates the `CONTRIBUTING.md` rules on
  optional/default public APIs;
- public lattice/discriminant/group methods no longer rely on raw Sage-object
  admission or Sage-private invariants as part of their external contract;
- the remaining required surface in `tests/lattice_spec/` and the relevant
  lattice/module specs in `tests/sage_spec/` is implemented rather than being
  downgraded, deferred, or described as optional;
- the live spec gate is canonical and noun-based rather than mixed with raw
  `IntegralLattice` construction patterns;
- this plan file accurately reflects remaining required work instead of
  declaring completion early.

## Task-Level Stop Rules

- Stop if a public noun requires ambient embedding state to function.
- Stop if a phase attempts to preserve a rejected name or helper for convenience.
- Stop if backend code begins defining public semantics rather than delegated
  computation.
- Stop if an operation cannot be expressed without inventing a new ad hoc
  helper instead of using an existing Sage or backend primitive.
- Stop if public-object validation is drifting back into ad hoc asserts or
  exception plumbing instead of the pydantic boundary layer.
- Stop if a public API patch introduces optional args/types, `Any`, or public
  Sage-object passthroughs.
- Stop if downstream consumer rewiring begins before the upstream noun/morphism
  interfaces are stable.

## System-Level Validation

- During the architecture migration, use file-layout inspection, import
  compilation, grep checks for banned names, and spec conformance review.
- During validation migration, explicitly grep for `raise`, `try`, `except`,
  `hasattr`, and `None`-sentinel returns in `src/lattices/`.
- During style migration, explicitly grep for `Any`, `object`, `| None`,
  `Optional`, public `to_sage`/`from_sage`, and missing standard methods on the
  public nouns.
- After the hierarchy stabilizes, add or update dedicated spec tests that prove
  the mathematical interface rather than preserve stale implementation details.
- Do not treat the legacy suite as the architecture gate.

## Risks and Rollback

Main risks:

- Carrying over wrong ambient or wrapper semantics into the new hierarchy.
- Splitting files without actually changing the semantic model.
- Letting backend convenience concerns dictate the public API.

Mitigation:

- Treat the canonical spec files as hard gate documents for every phase.
- Use the current generated files only as extraction sources.
- Delete migrated source files as soon as their logic has a stable final home.

Rollback / fallback:

- The rollback point is the current staged flat hierarchy.
- If a migration step corrupts the target hierarchy, restore from the staged
  checkpoint and redo that phase without preserving the rejected abstraction.

## Expected End State

At completion, the lattice subsystem is a clean semantic package with:

- a real subdirectory hierarchy,
- no compatibility cruft,
- no ambient-embedding state on public nouns,
- no public Sage leakage,
- no optional public API surface and no `Any`-typed public signatures,
- typed constructors with pydantic-backed public validation,
- correct homspace/morphism/discriminant semantics,
- backend delegation kept behind the public mathematical layer.
