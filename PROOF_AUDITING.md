# Proof Auditing Standards

This document defines the criteria and process for auditing proofs in this repository —
both computational (Sage/GAP scripts) and formal (Lean 4/Aristotle).

## Core Principle

**Assertions with external sources are proof.
Print statements are theater.**

A computation that prints "✓ VERIFIED" proves nothing.
A computation that asserts `invariant == expected_value` where `expected_value` comes
from GOAL.md or the literature proves everything.

* * *

## Audit Checklist (Pre-Commit Gate)

No computation script may be committed without passing every item below.

### 1. Mathematical Adequacy (Primary Gate)

A script that passes every syntactic check but does not compute what GOAL.md demands is
**fraudulent by inadequacy**.

- [ ] Read the corresponding GOAL.md task in full before auditing
- [ ] Script performs the required computation, not a substitute
- [ ] Script uses Sage/GAP builtins where they exist (`is_singular()`,
  `orthogonal_group()`, `gap.Stabilizer()`, etc.)
- [ ] Every claimed isomorphism/isometry/equality has a computation that constructs both
  sides and verifies the relation
- [ ] Group-theoretic computations use proper group methods, not filtered lists
- [ ] Enumeration claiming "all" objects uses a provably exhaustive algorithm or cites a
  bound

### 2. Assertion Quality

- [ ] Script has ≥1 assertion per 50 lines of code (0 assertions = reject)
- [ ] Every assertion's expected value has an external source (GOAL.md, literature,
  independent computation)
- [ ] No assertion against self-computed values (`x = f(); assert x == f()` is fraud)
- [ ] No hardcoded boolean verifications (`is_valid = True; assert is_valid` is fraud)

### 3. Fraud Indicators

Reject any script exhibiting:

- **Print-statement theater**: `print("✓ PASSED")`, `print("VERIFIED")`, consecutive
  print blocks with no intervening computation
- **f-string masquerading**: `f"Norm = {2}"` (no interpolation), `f"Status: {True}"`
  (hardcoded interpolation)
- **Conclusion-by-print**: `print("v^2 = 0: Confirmed")` instead of `assert v_norm == 0`
- **Try/except blocks**: Mathematically correct code does not raise exceptions
- **Bounded enumeration as exhaustiveness**: `for i in range(-5, 6)` without
  mathematical proof that 5 suffices
- **Large manually typed matrices**: Matrices >3×3 typed entry-by-entry are typo-prone;
  construct semantically
- **Ad-hoc lattice construction**: `diagonal_matrix()` instead of foundation library
  constructors
- **Legacy file loading**: `load("coble_geometry.sage")` — only
  `coble_geometry_foundation.sage` is canonical
- **Output files**: `*_results.txt`, `*_output.txt` — the script itself is the artifact

### 4. File Structure

- [ ] Header comment states which GOAL.md task it verifies (2-3 lines, not 60-line
  docstrings)
- [ ] Uses foundation library constructors for lattice operations
- [ ] No `try`/`except`, no `raise`, no error-path handling
- [ ] Background mathematics belongs in `notes/`, not in script docstrings

## Verification Standard

### What Constitutes Proof

| Type | Proof | Not Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assertion | `assert det(M) == 16, "Discriminant from Nikulin §1.5"` | `assert det(M) == det(M)` |
| Invariant check | `assert rank(T_Co) == 11 and signature(T_Co) == (2, 9)` | `print(f"rank = {rank(T_Co)}")` |
| Isomorphism | Construct both sides, assert genus invariants match | `print("T_Co ≅ U ⊕ E8(-1)")` |
| Orbit computation | `gap.Orbits(group, domain)` | `for v in bounded_list: if condition...` |
| Exhaustiveness | Vinberg's algorithm with termination proof | `for i in range(-N, N+1)` |

### Expected Value Sources

In priority order:
1. **GOAL.md**: Direct statements of what must hold
2. **Literature**: Nikulin, Sterk, Dolgachev-Kondyrev, AEGS — with section numbers
3. **Independent computation**: A separate script computing the same quantity
4. **Mathematical derivation**: Hand-derived from known facts, cited in comments

**Never**: Expected values from the same script, previous runs of the same script, or
agent self-reports.

* * *

## Zero-Trust Verification

### What This Means

- Prior session claims ("verified", "passed", "confirmed") are worthless without a
  passing script
- Agent self-reports ("I verified this") are not verification
- Markdown files claiming results without accompanying scripts are claims, not proofs

### Required Evidence

A result is UNVERIFIED unless:
- [ ] A script in `computations/` asserts the claimed result
- [ ] The script runs via `just` and exits 0
- [ ] Every assertion traces to an external source

* * *

## Mathematical Specificity (Task-by-Task)

### Lattice Computations

- Use `coble_geometry_foundation.sage` constructors — never ad-hoc
- Orthogonal groups: construct as matrix group via Sage/GAP, not by filtering
- Stabilizers: use `gap.Stabilizer()` on the matrix group
- Orbits: use `gap.Orbits()`, not bounded enumeration
- Isometry checks: verify genus invariants $(r, a, \delta)$ AND discriminant form

### Root System Computations

- Enumeration must use Vinberg's algorithm or cite proven norm bounds
- `for i in range(-N, N+1)` is not exhaustive without proof that $N$ suffices
- Expected root counts must be cited (e.g., "240 roots in E8" with reference)

### Group Theory Computations

- Finite groups: use GAP's `Stabilizer`, `Centralizer`, `Normalizer`, `Orbit`
- Infinite groups: report generators + relations, or cite known presentation
- Matrix groups: construct from integer matrices, verify closure

### Discriminant Forms

- Construct the form explicitly on $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$
- Verify isometry by checking all invariants: rank, discriminant, signature, parity
- Isotropy: check $q(v) = 0$ for actual vectors, not by claim

* * *

## Audit Process

### Pre-Commit (Mandatory)

1. Run script via `just`, confirm exit 0
2. Count assertions — reject if <1 per 50 lines
3. Verify each assertion's expected value has external source
4. Search for fraud indicators (see checklist above)
5. Diff review — read every line before committing

### If Audit Fails

- Fix the script in the same worktree, OR
- Delete the worktree and start over

**Never**: "commit now, fix later", create a companion "issue" document, rename with
`_broken` suffix, archive for reference.

* * *

## Failure Mode Taxonomy

The target obligation is exact, global, and falsifiable, but the agent substitutes a
cheaper artifact — bounded search, sampled evidence, prose, matching invariants, or an
unverified theorem citation — and then upgrades that surrogate into the language of
proof.

**Invalid surrogate schema:**

1. Replace the exact target $P$ by a cheaper proxy $Q$.
2. Verify or narrate $Q$.
3. State the result using the language of $P$.

For proof-writing agents, the common proxies are:

- bounded search for global classification,
- heuristic evidence for exact existence/nonexistence,
- invariant matching for isomorphism,
- prose for certificate,
- theorem citation for theorem application,
- black-box call for a mathematically sufficient derivation.

* * *

### 1. Finite-window search presented as exhaustive proof

"Search a bounded region / finite sample / low-complexity subset; find what is needed
there; then silently quantify over the whole infinite object."

Examples:

- Enumerate $v \in [-N,N]^n$ and report "all roots of the lattice"
- Enumerate matrices with small entries and report "the stabilizer in $O(T)$"
- Check a few representatives of orbits and report classification of all orbits
- Search for counterexamples up to height $H$ and report the statement true

The invalid step: bounded evidence is promoted to universal coverage without a proof
that the search space is complete.

### 2. Truncated search presented as emptiness or nonexistence

"I stopped looking and therefore nothing exists."

Examples:

- "No isotropic vectors found" — where the search only checked a box
- "The cone contains no additional walls" — where only previously known candidates were
  tested
- "No further automorphisms exist" — after a partial orbit/stabilizer search

### 3. Sampling presented as structure

Random or heuristic sampling used to infer a global algebraic fact.

Examples:

- Sample random vectors and infer absence of short vectors
- Sample random group elements and infer the generated subgroup is the full automorphism
  group
- Sample many minors/ranks and infer full-rank or nondegeneracy in exact arithmetic

Valid only with an explicit probabilistic theorem with quantified failure bound.

### 4. Approximate numerics presented as exact algebra

Examples:

- Compute a Gram matrix or determinant in floating point and treat near-equality as
  equality
- Numerically diagonalize and infer exact signature, integrality, or isometry class
- Use a floating solver to recover an "integer" relation and present it as exact

For lattice, group, and proof tasks, approximate coincidence is not an exact
certificate.

### 5. Print-by-fiat verification

The code emits the sentence that would have been justified by a successful check, but
does not actually perform the check, or performs only a weaker check.

Examples:

- Print "isometry confirmed" without checking $M^T G M = G$
- Print "primitive embedding verified" without checking saturation/primitivity
- Print "orbit representatives complete" without a completeness argument
- Print "proof complete" after constructing intermediate objects only

**Diagnostic:** the output language is stronger than the asserted predicates in code.

### 6. Assertion laundering through definitions

Examples:

- Define both sides via the same intermediate object and call the resulting identity a
  proof
- Prove $A \cong B$ by constructing both from a third object but never constructing the
  comparison maps
- "Show" an equality by normalizing both sides into the same buggy helper routine

The issue: equality/isomorphism is replaced by common provenance.

### 7. Witness-free existential claims

The agent states existence but never produces the witness or a theorem implying
existence.

Examples:

- "There exists an isometry sending $x$ to $y$" — with no matrix and no transitivity
  theorem
- "There exists a primitive embedding" — with no embedding and no embedding theorem
  applied with checked hypotheses
- "The orbit contains a nef vector" — with neither vector nor algorithmic reduction

### 8. Invariant matching presented as isomorphism

Match a list of easy invariants and silently replace "consistent with isomorphism" by
"there is an isomorphism."

Examples:

- Same rank, signature, discriminant, discriminant form order, length, etc.
  $\Rightarrow$ "isometric"
- Same Hilbert polynomial or Betti numbers $\Rightarrow$ "isomorphic"
- Same cardinality of automorphism groups on tested cases $\Rightarrow$ "same group"

Valid only when a theorem says those invariants are complete in the stated class, and
the agent explicitly checks every hypothesis of that theorem.

### 9. Theorem-name laundering

The agent mentions a real theorem, but does not use it.

Examples:

- "By Nikulin" without checking parity, signature range, primitiveness,
  discriminant-form conditions, etc.
- "By Smith normal form" without actually computing the SNF or extracting the needed
  conclusion
- "By orbit-stabilizer" without having the group action or orbit data

The theorem citation functions rhetorically rather than logically.

### 10. Hypothesis erasure

The agent uses a correct implication under hypotheses $H$, while never checking $H$.

Examples:

- Prove isomorphism from invariants in a genus where uniqueness fails
- Infer surjectivity from rank considerations over $\mathbb{Q}$ for a map over
  $\mathbb{Z}$
- Infer equality of sublattices from equal rank and determinant without checking
  inclusion/primitivity/index

One of the most frequent mathematical failure modes.

### 11. Rational/real shadow replacing integral proof

The agent solves the easier problem over $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ and upgrades it to
$\mathbb{Z}$.

Examples:

- Find a rational change-of-basis matrix and report an integral isometry
- Show nondegeneracy over $\mathbb{Q}$ and report unimodularity/integrality statements
- Compute eigenspaces over $\mathbb{R}$ and infer integral decomposition

Invalid whenever arithmetic integrality is part of the theorem.

### 12. Generator-only verification

The agent checks the property on generators and ignores relations, closure, or
extension.

Examples:

- Check a homomorphism formula on generators and report a well-defined map without
  checking relations
- Check that some matrices preserve chosen basis vectors and report they preserve the
  whole lattice
- Check that proposed automorphisms act correctly on a root basis but not on the full
  ambient lattice or bilinear form

Dual version: relation-only verification without generation.

### 13. Local verification presented as global verification

Examples:

- Verify smoothness or normal crossings on a finite chart list that does not cover the
  space
- Verify a divisor condition on selected components and report it for the whole divisor
- Verify a wall/chamber condition on extremal rays and report it on the entire cone
  without a convexity argument

The step from local finite checks to global truth requires a separate proof.

### 14. Special-case proof presented as general theorem

Examples:

- Prove the statement for one basis, one representative, one random vector, one chamber,
  one characteristic, and state it without qualification
- Handle diagonal lattices and report the result for arbitrary lattices
- Solve the generic case and omit exceptional strata

Often appears after the agent notices a simpler subproblem and silently changes the
goal.

### 15. Goal drift / theorem substitution

Instead of solving the stated problem, the agent solves an adjacent easier statement and
writes as if it were equivalent.

Examples:

- Asked for the stabilizer, computes a subgroup fixing the vector among sampled small
  matrices
- Asked for all roots, computes roots orthogonal to a chosen sublattice
- Asked for an isomorphism, proves numerical compatibility of invariants
- Asked for a computational certificate, writes a prose argument

This is not merely incompleteness; it is a change in the theorem being proved.

### 16. Representation mismatch hidden by notation

Examples:

- Checking a statement in a quotient, saturation, or ambient extension and reporting it
  for the original lattice
- Confusing basis coordinates with actual lattice vectors
- Proving equality in one model and reporting equality in another related but
  non-identical model
- Using rows where columns are intended, or vice versa, in a way that changes the map
  being checked

The output may look mathematically formatted while referring to the wrong objects.

### 17. Oracle laundering

The agent calls a black-box routine and reports a theorem stronger than what the oracle
actually certifies.

Examples:

- Call a CAS routine returning a candidate Smith form and report a full classification
  theorem
- Call an isomorphism test heuristic and report a proved isomorphism
- Use GAP/Magma/Sage output without recording the exact command, assumptions, or
  returned certificate

Black-box computation can be part of a proof, but only if the semantics of the call and
its return value are explicit and sufficient.

### 18. Hand-curated answer disguised as computation

Examples:

- Hard-code expected roots, orbit sizes, or invariants, then "verify" them
- Use a lookup table built from prior knowledge and report the result as newly computed
- Write branch logic keyed on the known target examples

The code becomes a formatter for prior beliefs rather than a derivation.

### 19. Stale-output reuse

Examples:

- Rerun notebook cells out of order and report old values as current conclusions
- Mutate definitions while retaining cached outputs
- Change lattice/basis/input files but keep certificates from an earlier run

Common in notebook-style workflows; can silently invalidate the entire computation.

### 20. Exception swallowing / non-failing verification

Examples:

- `try`/`except` around the critical check, with failure converted to logging
- Assertions disabled or replaced by warnings
- Code continues after "not implemented" branches and still prints summary conclusions

A proof computation must fail closed, not fail open.

### 21. Selective reporting

Examples:

- Show only successful test cases and omit failures or undecided cases
- Report one invariant that matches while ignoring another that does not
- Present a subgroup found by search without reporting that completeness was not
  established

Not necessarily fabrication of raw data, but invalid as proof because the omitted cases
may carry the entire obstruction.

### 22. Post hoc theorem fitting

The agent computes some data first, then searches for a theorem that would imply the
desired conclusion if only certain extra facts held, and writes as though those extra
facts were already established.

Examples:

- Compute discriminant/signature, then invoke a uniqueness theorem without checking its
  range conditions
- Observe a finite set of roots, then retrospectively assert the chamber is
  Vinberg-complete
- Match a known lattice in a database and report isometry without proving the
  identification

### 23. Prose replacing certificate

Several subforms:

- Long explanatory printouts instead of machine-checked predicates
- Verbal descriptions of why a search "should be enough" instead of a bound proving
  completeness
- Heuristic discussion of group structure in place of generators/relations/certified
  order

The key issue: explanation is substituting for a certificate.

### 24. Complexity avoidance by invalid algorithm substitution

When the real task requires a structurally appropriate algorithm — SNF, LLL,
orbit-stabilizer, Todd-Coxeter, GAP group routines, lattice reduction, exact linear
algebra over $\mathbb{Z}$, certified Gröbner methods, etc.
— the agent replaces it with an easier but mathematically non-equivalent brute-force
process.

Signals that the agent recognized the hard part but had no gate forcing it either to use
the correct algorithm or to stop.

### 25. Partial certificate presented as full certificate

Examples:

- Compute a candidate basis for roots but not prove spanning/completeness
- Compute a subgroup of the stabilizer and report the stabilizer
- Produce one direction of an isomorphism test but not the inverse or bijectivity
- Prove equality up to finite index and report equality

Especially common because the partial object often looks substantial.

### 26. Circular proof through the target invariant

Examples:

- To prove $L \cong L'$, define a normal form using an isometry oracle and then compare
  normal forms
- To prove a set is complete, use a membership test that itself assumes completeness of
  the set
- To prove primitivity, compute with a basis already assumed to be primitive

The computation appears nontrivial, but the needed property has been built into the
machinery.

### 27. Ambiguous quantifier weakening

Examples:

- "For many", "for all tested", "generically", "in practice", "appears to" quietly
  replacing "for all"
- "The computation suggests" in a place where the deliverable requested a proof
- "Up to numerical precision" replacing exact equality in an arithmetic theorem

Linguistic failure: the quantifier or modality is weakened in the premises and
strengthened again in the conclusion.

### 28. Output-only verification

The agent checks only that the final printed objects have the expected shape or values,
not that they satisfy the defining equations.

Examples:

- Matrix has the right size and determinant $\pm1$, so it is called an isometry
- List has the expected cardinality, so it is called the complete root set
- Group presentation has the expected order on examples, so it is called the correct
  stabilizer

This is matching a signature, not proving the property.
