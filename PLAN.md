# Coble Moduli Project Plan

## Goal

**Current state**: Project is 90% complete toward GOAL.md objectives.
Critical issue: Task3_2 orbit uniqueness claim is mathematically invalid (used "Arf
invariant" which doesn't exist over Z). Process issue: Lattice constructions are
inconsistent across scripts.

**Target state**: All GOAL.md Priority 1-3 objectives complete and verified:
- Priority 1: Literature spine complete with all gaps documented
- Priority 2: All computational claims verified and aligned with literature
- Priority 3: All computational blocks resolved

**Why this matters**: Mathematical correctness and reproducibility.
Invalid verification undermines all downstream work.
Inconsistent constructions create confusion about lattice structure.

## Constraints

**Required**:
- Use GAP's built-in orbit functions for task3_2 (no custom algorithms)
- All lattice constructions via IntegralLattice.direct_sum() (not diagonal matrices)
- All mathematical concepts must pass Phase 0 blocking gates (formal definitions,
  applicability)
- Literature claims must cite specific sources

**Forbidden**:
- Any mention of "Arf invariant" in code or documentation
- Ad-hoc lattice constructions bypassing coble_geometry.sage
- Verification that compares documentation to itself
- Claiming literature support without specific citations

**Approval gates**: None - autonomous execution

## Prerequisites

- [x] Sage environment available
- [x] GAP available via Sage
- [x] Lean toolchain available (source ~/.envrc)
- [x] Literature spine established (REFERENCES.md with 13 sources)
- [x] Verification process with blocking gates (audit/verification_process.md)
- [x] Project state assessment complete (audit/project_state_assessment.md)

## Scope

**Included** (Complete path to GOAL.md Priorities 1-3):
- Task3_2 orbit verification via GAP (Priority 2, CRITICAL)
- Standardize lattice constructions (Priority 2, PROCESS)
- Document remaining literature gaps (Priority 1)
- Verify all scripts run after changes (Priority 2)

**Excluded**:
- Lean formalization (Priority 4, secondary)
- New computational searches
- Acquiring paywalled literature (blocked on external access)

## Phase 1: Fix Task3_2 Orbit Verification (CRITICAL)

**Goal**: Replace invalid Arf invariant approach with correct GAP orbit computation

### Task 1.1: Delegate GAP orbit computation to Prover subagent

**Location**: Delegate to Prover subagent

**Description**: Compute orbits of O(q_T) acting on 15 primitive isotropic plane images
in discriminant group A_T using GAP

**Dependencies**: None

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Actual orbit count computed via GAP's `Orbits()` or equivalent function
- Code uses standard GAP orbit functions (not custom BFS/DFS)
- If single orbit: cites Nikulin Prop 1.5.2 for theoretical justification
- Zero mentions of "Arf invariant"
- Clear distinction between EVIDENCE (enumeration) and PROOF/CONJECTURE (orbit count)

**Validation**: Review subagent transcript for:
```bash
# Check for GAP orbit computation
grep -i "Orbits\|orbit" transcript
# Verify no Arf contamination
grep -i "arf" transcript  # Must return nothing
```

### Task 1.2: Update task3_2 computation script

**Location**: `computations/task3_2_isotropic_planes.sage`

**Description**: Remove lines 620-653 (Arf invariant computation), replace with GAP
orbit computation from Task 1.1

**Dependencies**: Task 1.1 complete

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Zero occurrences of "Arf" in script
- GAP orbit computation code present (from Task 1.1)
- Script runs successfully
- Output file contains orbit count

**Validation**:
```bash
cd computations
sage task3_2_isotropic_planes.sage
grep -c "Arf" task3_2_isotropic_planes.sage  # Must return 0
test -f task3_2_output.txt && echo "Output exists"
```

### Task 1.3: Update task3_2 proof note

**Location**: `proofs/solved/task3_2_isotropic_planes.md`

**Description**: Replace invalid Arf invariant reasoning with correct GAP orbit
verification

**Dependencies**: Task 1.2 complete

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Zero occurrences of "Arf" in proof note
- Correct orbit count from GAP computation
- Proper citations (Nikulin Prop 1.5.2 if single orbit, AEGS 2023 for context)
- Clear distinction between enumeration (EVIDENCE) and orbit computation (PROOF or
  CONJECTURE)
- Mathematical validity: all concepts properly defined

**Validation**:
```bash
grep -c "Arf" proofs/solved/task3_2_isotropic_planes.md  # Must return 0
grep -i "orbit" proofs/solved/task3_2_isotropic_planes.md  # Should find orbit discussion
```

## Phase 2: Standardize Lattice Constructions (PROCESS)

**Goal**: All lattices constructed via canonical direct sums, eliminating
basis-dependent confusion

### Task 2.1: Update coble_geometry.sage with direct sum constructors

**Location**: `computations/coble_geometry.sage`

**Description**: Add canonical lattice constructors using IntegralLattice.direct_sum():
- `rank_one_lattice(n)`: ⟨n⟩ lattice
- `S_Co_lattice()`: ⟨2⟩ ⊕ ⟨-2⟩¹⁰ via direct_sum
- `T_Co_lattice()`: ⟨2⟩ ⊕ U ⊕ E8(-1) via direct_sum
- `T_En_lattice()`: ⟨2⟩² ⊕ ⟨-2⟩⁸ via direct_sum
- `Lambda_K3_lattice()`: U³ ⊕ E8(-1)² via direct_sum

Keep existing diagonal matrix versions for backward compatibility but mark as
deprecated.

**Dependencies**: None

**Acceptance criteria**:
- All new constructors use IntegralLattice.direct_sum()
- Signature, determinant, discriminant group invariants match expected values
- Existing code still works (backward compatible)
- Documentation comments explain canonical construction

**Validation**:
```python
# In Sage:
load("computations/coble_geometry.sage")
S = S_Co_lattice()
assert S.signature() == (1, 10)
assert S.determinant() == 2048
T = T_Co_lattice()
assert T.signature() == (2, 9)
assert T.determinant() == -2048
```

### Task 2.2: Audit computation scripts for non-standard constructions

**Location**: All files in `computations/`

**Description**: Identify scripts constructing lattices without using
coble_geometry.sage

**Dependencies**: Task 2.1 complete

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Complete list of scripts with non-standard constructions
- Assessment of which need updating vs which are intentionally custom
- Document findings in audit/lattice_construction_audit.md

**Validation**:
```bash
cd computations
# Find diagonal matrix constructions
grep -l "diagonal_matrix.*2.*-2" *.sage | grep -v coble_geometry.sage > /tmp/diagonal_constructions.txt
# Find direct IntegralLattice constructions
grep -l "IntegralLattice(matrix" *.sage | grep -v coble_geometry.sage > /tmp/direct_constructions.txt
# Count findings
wc -l /tmp/diagonal_constructions.txt /tmp/direct_constructions.txt
```

### Task 2.3: Update scripts to use standardized constructors

**Location**: Scripts identified in Task 2.2

**Description**: Replace ad-hoc constructions with calls to coble_geometry.sage
canonical constructors

**Dependencies**: Task 2.2 complete

**Acceptance criteria**:
- All scripts use coble_geometry.sage for T_Co, S_Co, T_En, Lambda_K3
- All scripts run successfully
- Mathematical results unchanged (invariants match, orbit counts same, etc.)
- Output files regenerated and verified

**Validation**: For each updated script:
```bash
cd computations
sage <script_name>.sage
# Compare invariants in new vs old output
diff <old_output> <new_output> | grep -E "signature|determinant|discriminant"
```

## Phase 3: Document Remaining Literature Gaps (DOCUMENTATION)

**Goal**: Explicitly document all literature gaps as either resolvable or blocked on
external access

### Task 3.1: Update GAPS.md with literature gap status

**Location**: `GAPS.md`

**Description**: Clearly mark each literature gap as:
- RESOLVABLE: Can be addressed with available resources
- BLOCKED: Requires institutional access, purchase, or author contact
- INDEPENDENT: Repo-native construction, not connected to literature

**Dependencies**: None

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Every literature gap has explicit status (RESOLVABLE/BLOCKED/INDEPENDENT)
- J. Thas primary source marked as BLOCKED
- Coolidge extraction marked as BLOCKED
- Task1_1 sextics marked as INDEPENDENT unless connected to literature
- 10/13 unavailable sources marked as BLOCKED

**Validation**: Review GAPS.md for:
- All gaps have status labels
- No ambiguous "needs investigation" language
- Clear next actions for RESOLVABLE gaps

### Task 3.2: Attempt to connect task1_1 sextics to Coble/Coolidge

**Location**: Delegate to General subagent for literature search

**Description**: Search acquired literature (Dolgachev-Kondō 2013, AEGS 2023, Thas 1994)
for connections to task1_1 parametrizations

**Dependencies**: Task 3.1 complete

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Explicit search of all 3 acquired papers
- Document findings (connections found or not found)
- Update GAPS.md with results
- If no connections: confirm task1_1 as INDEPENDENT construction

**Validation**: Check audit/ for search report documenting:
- Papers searched
- Search terms used
- Findings (connections or lack thereof)

## Phase 4: System-Level Verification (VALIDATION)

**Goal**: Verify all changes work correctly and project is in consistent state

### Task 4.1: Run all computation scripts

**Location**: `computations/`

**Description**: Execute all 20 computation scripts and verify they complete without
errors

**Dependencies**: Phase 1, 2 complete

**Acceptance criteria**:
- All 20 scripts run without errors
- All output files generated
- No Arf contamination in any output

**Validation**:
```bash
cd computations
for f in task*.sage; do 
  echo "Running $f..."
  sage "$f" || echo "FAILED: $f"
done
# Check for Arf contamination
grep -r "Arf" . --include="*.sage" --include="*.txt" | wc -l  # Must be 0
```

### Task 4.2: Verify proof notes align with outputs

**Location**: `proofs/solved/`

**Description**: Spot-check that proof notes accurately reflect current computation
outputs

**Dependencies**: Task 4.1 complete

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Sample 3 proof notes and verify claims match output files
- No overclaiming (proof notes don't claim more than outputs show)
- All citations present and correct

**Validation**: Manual review of 3 randomly selected proof notes against their output
files

### Task 4.3: Update PLAN.md with completion status

**Location**: `PLAN.md`

**Description**: Mark all completed tasks, update project completion percentage

**Dependencies**: All phases complete

**Acceptance criteria**:
- All task checkboxes marked complete
- Project completion percentage updated (should be ~95%)
- Any remaining gaps documented with clear status

**Validation**: Review PLAN.md execution checklist - all items should be [x] or [-] with
reasons

## System-Level Validation

**End-to-end checks**:
- All 20 computation scripts run without errors
- Task3_2 produces valid orbit count via GAP
- All lattice constructions produce consistent invariants
- Zero Arf contamination in codebase
- All GOAL.md Priority 1-3 objectives addressed

**Real-use smoke checks**:
```bash
# Verify all scripts run
cd computations && for f in task*.sage; do sage "$f" || echo "FAIL: $f"; done

# Verify zero Arf contamination
grep -r "Arf" . --include="*.sage" --include="*.md" --include="*.txt" | wc -l  # Must be 0

# Verify standardized constructions
grep -c "load.*coble_geometry" computations/task*.sage  # Should be high

# Verify proof notes exist for all tasks
ls proofs/solved/task*.md | wc -l  # Should be 10
```

## Risks / Rollback

**Risks**:
- GAP orbit computation may be slow or fail for large groups
- Standardized constructions may expose bugs in existing code
- Gram matrices will change (basis change) even though invariants match
- Literature search may find no connections (task1_1 remains independent)

**Mitigations**:
- Use reasonable timeout for GAP computation (30 minutes)
- Verify invariants (signature, determinant, discriminant group) match before/after
- Document that Gram matrix changes are expected (basis change, not mathematical change)
- Accept task1_1 as independent construction if no literature connections found

**Rollback path**:
- Git commit after each task
- Can revert individual tasks via git
- Preserve old output files for comparison
- Archive old scripts if needed

## Stop Rules

**Do not proceed if**:
- GAP orbit computation fails or times out → investigate alternative approaches or
  accept as CONJECTURE
- Standardized constructions produce different invariants → investigate mathematical
  error, rollback
- Any script fails after standardization → rollback that script, investigate
- Verification reveals mathematical errors → stop, create new plan to address errors

- Priority 2 (Numerical evidence): 90% → 100% (task3_2 fixed, constructions
  standardized)
- Priority 3 (Computational blocks): 100% (no work needed)
- Priority 4 (Lean formalization): 0% (secondary, not planned)
