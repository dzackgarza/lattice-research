# Algebras Mapping

`Algebras(R)` is the category of algebras over `R`. Algebra-specific methods belong in
this subtree. Ring and module methods are inherited from `rings` and `modules`.

| Source surface | Target surface | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Matrix-ring algebra methods | `Algebras(R)` plus matrix-algebra subcategories | A matrix ring is also an algebra over its base ring; algebra methods should not be redeclared in the ring subtree. |
| `FreeAlgebra(R, n, names)` and `algebras.Free(R, n, names)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_set(generators=S)` | This is the true free associative unital `R`-algebra on a set of symbols. Sage's `Sets().example().algebra(R)` is not this construction. |
| Plain-set Sage `S.algebra(R)` and `Sets().Algebras(R)` | `Modules(R).Constructors().CombinatorialFreeModule(basis_keys=S)`, exposed by `S.free_module(R)` | Sage already constructs the free `R`-module with basis indexed by `S` on this path. The spec routes that Sage source surface to `Modules(R)` and rejects it as evidence for an `Algebras(R)` constructor. |
| `S.algebra(R)` where the selected source category is `Magmas()` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_magma(magma=S)` | This names the free functor from magmas to the corresponding category of `R`-algebra objects with bilinear multiplication. |
| `S.algebra(R)` where the selected source category is `Semigroups()` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_semigroup(semigroup=S)` | This names the free functor from semigroups to the corresponding associative `R`-algebra objects. |
| `S.algebra(R)` for a Sage monoid `S` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_monoid(monoid=S)` | This is the monoid algebra `R[S]`, the free construction relative to the multiplicative-monoid forgetful functor. |
| `G.algebra(R)` for a Sage group `G`; `GroupAlgebra(G, R)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_group(group=G)` | The essential image of the group free functor lands in Hopf algebras over `R`; as an `R`-algebra it is the group algebra `R[G]`. |
| `S.algebra(R, category=AdditiveSemigroups())` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_additive_semigroup(semigroup=S)` | This is the semigroup algebra using the additively written operation as multiplication of basis elements. |
| `S.algebra(R, category=AdditiveMonoids())` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_additive_monoid(monoid=S)` | This is the monoid algebra using the additively written operation and zero element as multiplicative unit data. |
| `S.algebra(R, category=AdditiveGroups())` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_additive_group(group=S)` | This is the group algebra using the additively written group law. |
| `FiniteDimensionalAlgebra(k, table, assume_associative=True, assume_unital=True)` | First construct `mu: Tensor` through `TensorAlgebraComponents(k).Constructors().from_module_element_matrix(...)` or another tensor interop constructor, then call `Algebras(k).Constructors().from_multiplication_tensor(multiplication=mu)`. | Bespoke table/list/matrix shapes are tensor interop inputs, not algebra constructor inputs. The algebra constructor has one canonical product input: a tensor in `T_R(M)[1, 2]`. The tensor's parent determines the base module, the base ring, and the preferred generating set. |
| `FiniteDimensionalAlgebra(k, table)` without both associative and unital assumptions | Mathematically justified non-mapping to `Algebras(k)`; map to magmatic or associative nonunital algebra surfaces when those subtrees exist. | Sage says the default object is a magmatic algebra, not necessarily associative or unital. |
| `AlgebrasWithBasis(R)` | `Algebras(R).WithBasis()` | `WithBasis` is shared module/vector-space vocabulary. The distinguished basis is structure on the algebra; multiplication remains element multiplication. |
| `CombinatorialFreeModule(R, basis_keys, category=AlgebrasWithBasis(R))` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().from_multiplication_tensor(multiplication=mu)` after constructing `mu` in `TensorAlgebraComponents(R)` | Sage uses this as infrastructure for algebras with basis, but the constructor alone supplies only the module with basis. The project constructor must specify the multiplication tensor mathematically; Sage `product_on_basis` is only an interop hook derived from that tensor. |
| `basis()` on an algebra with a distinguished basis | `AlgebraBasis` | The chosen basis is part of the structure of `WithBasis`; basis-returning helpers for derived subobjects are not separate public surfaces. |
| `one_basis()` | `one() -> AlgebraElement` plus constructor unit data when the unit is supplied by coordinates | Sage exposes the basis index of the unit when the unit is a basis vector. The project surface exposes the unit as an algebra element; a basis index is interop data only. |
| `product_on_basis(i, j)` | `AlgebraElement.__mul__` on basis elements, extended bilinearly to all algebra elements | Sage exposes multiplication through basis indices. The project surface is element multiplication; construction supplies the multiplication tensor that makes `e_i * e_j` evaluate. |
| `algebra_generators()` | `AlgebraElementFamily` | Algebra generators form a family of algebra elements, not a generic set family. |
| `FiniteDimensionalAlgebrasWithBasis(R)` | `Algebras(R).FiniteDimensional().WithBasis()` | `FiniteDimensional` is shared vector-space vocabulary. This intersection is where Sage implements radical, center, idempotent lifting, Peirce decomposition, and semisimple quotients for algebras with basis. |
| `SemisimpleAlgebras(R)` | `Algebras(R).Semisimple()` | Semisimplicity uses the shared `Semisimple` axiom; algebra subcategories supply the algebra-specific method surface. |
| `CommutativeAlgebras(R)` | `Algebras(R).Commutative()` | Commutativity uses the shared `Commutative` axiom; this algebra surface records algebra-specific consequences without redefining the axiom. |
| `WithBasis`, `FiniteDimensional`, `Commutative`, `Semisimple` | shared axiom names from `axioms.py` | The algebra subtree contributes algebra-specific method surfaces for these restrictions instead of defining separate algebra-only axiom names. |
| `subalgebra(gens, category=None, *args, **opts)` | `subalgebra(generators)` | The generated subalgebra is algebra structure. Sage's `category` and option bag are implementation routing for the resulting submodule, not public algebra data. |
| `ideal_submodule(gens, side='left', category=None, *args, **opts)` | `left_ideal(generators)`, `right_ideal(generators)`, `two_sided_ideal(generators)` | The finite Sage side string is split into named ideal methods. Algebra ideals are module subobjects with left/right/two-sided predicates, so no side flag or category option is exposed. |
| `principal_ideal(a, side='left', *args, **opts)` | `principal_left_ideal(generator)`, `principal_right_ideal(generator)`, `principal_two_sided_ideal(generator)` | Principal ideal construction is the one-generator case of the corresponding named ideal operation. Sage's `coerce` option is compatibility plumbing and is not a category obligation. |
| `center`, `radical`, derivation and Hochschild methods | Algebra parent method surface | These methods depend on algebra structure, not merely ring or module structure. |
| `center_basis()` | `center() -> Algebra` | The public surface returns the center as the algebra spanned by that basis. The basis itself is implementation/inventory data recoverable from the returned object when it lies in `WithBasis`. |
| `radical_basis()` | `radical() -> AlgebraIdeal` | The public surface returns the radical as the ideal spanned by that basis, not a bare basis list. `AlgebraIdeal` is an `R`-module subobject in `Algebras(R).Ideals(A)`, not a ring ideal and not an algebra subobject. |
| `derivations_basis()` | `derivations() -> RModule` | The public surface returns the module or Lie algebra of derivations. A basis is recovered from that object when a basis has been chosen. |
| `annihilator_basis(...)` | `annihilator(...) -> AlgebraIdeal` | The public surface returns the annihilator ideal spanned by Sage's basis output. `AlgebraIdeal` carries `is_left_ideal()`, `is_right_ideal()`, and `is_two_sided_ideal()` predicates. |
| Quotients, subobjects, Cartesian products, tensor products, duals | `Algebras(R).<Construction>()` | These are construction categories attachable to arbitrary algebra subcategories by `category_of(self)`. Algebra subobjects are subalgebras; algebra ideals live in `Algebras(R).Ideals(A)` and inherit `ambient()`, `ambient_module()`, and `inclusion()` from `Modules(R).Subobjects()`. By construction, that ambient module is the algebra `A` viewed as an `R`-module. |
| Topological algebras | `Algebras(R)` plus `topological_spaces` | Topological-space methods belong to the topological-space subtree and should be inherited. |

Slice and coslice algebra objects keep the algebra-specific names
`structure_algebra()` and `structure_map()`. The old local
`Algebras(R).ObjectsOver(A).ParentMethods.structure_domain()` /
`structure_codomain()` and `Algebras(R).ObjectsUnder(A)` versions now map through the
Cat-owned universal `structure_morphism().domain()` and
`structure_morphism().codomain()` surface. This preserves the old behavior while
placing domain and codomain on the generic structure-morphism owner.

## Free-Construction Routing

For source categories admitted in this subtree, the public method on a source object is
`S.free_algebra(R)`. The source category, not a runtime `category=` keyword, chooses
the constructor. The `Sets()` row below is carried out by
`Sets.ParentMethods.free_algebra`, backed by Sage `FreeAlgebra`; it is not Sage's
plain-set `S.algebra(R)` path. The `Magmas()`, `Semigroups()`, `Monoids()`, and
`Groups()` rows record target constructor stubs in `Algebras(R).Constructors()`;
matching source-method stubs belong to those source-category subtrees when this project
admits them.

| Source category for `S` | Public source method | Constructor target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Sets()` | `S.free_algebra(R)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_set(S)` |
| `Magmas()` | `S.free_algebra(R)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_magma(S)` |
| `Semigroups()` | `S.free_algebra(R)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_semigroup(S)` |
| `Monoids()` | `S.free_algebra(R)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_monoid(S)` |
| `Groups()` | `S.free_algebra(R)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_group(S)` |
| `AdditiveSemigroups()` | `S.free_algebra(R)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_additive_semigroup(S)` |
| `AdditiveMonoids()` | `S.free_algebra(R)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_additive_monoid(S)` |
| `AdditiveGroups()` | `S.free_algebra(R)` | `Algebras(R).Constructors().free_algebra_from_additive_group(S)` |

`Groups()` are not an unrelated constructor family: the group construction refines the
monoid construction, and its essential image lies in Hopf algebras over `R`.

The commutative additive source categories refine the corresponding additive rows. The
selected operation must be represented by the source category method, and the target
constructor name must say which source category is being used. Do not expose Sage's
generic `category=` disambiguation as project API.

Concrete constructor status:

| Constructor | Current route |
| --- | --- |
| `free_algebra_from_set(S)` | Sage `FreeAlgebra(R, |S|, names)`, refined to `Algebras(R).WithBasis()`. This is the true free associative unital algebra on generators. |
| `free_algebra_from_monoid(M)` | Sage `M.algebra(R, category=Monoids())`, refined to `Algebras(R).WithBasis()`. The monoid unit supplies the algebra unit. |
| `free_algebra_from_group(G)` | Sage `G.algebra(R, category=Groups())`, refined to `Algebras(R).WithBasis()`. Group-specific Hopf structure remains a later refinement, not a separate constructor path. |
| `free_algebra_from_additive_monoid(M)` | Sage `M.algebra(R, category=AdditiveMonoids())`, refined to `Algebras(R).WithBasis()`. The additive zero supplies the algebra unit. |
| `free_algebra_from_additive_group(G)` | Sage `G.algebra(R, category=AdditiveGroups())`, refined to `Algebras(R).WithBasis()`. |
| `free_algebra_from_magma(M)` | Precise stub only. Sage routes this to magmatic algebras; this subtree has no magmatic/nonassociative algebra target yet. |
| `free_algebra_from_semigroup(S)` | Precise stub only. Sage routes this to associative algebras that need not be unital; this subtree has no nonunital associative-algebra target yet. |
| `free_algebra_from_additive_semigroup(S)` | Precise stub only. This is the additive analogue of the semigroup route and has the same missing nonunital target. |

## Plain-Set Sage Algebra Route

Sage's plain-set `S.algebra(R)` path is a module construction in the project spec:

| Sage source path | Project source spelling | Target constructor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `S.algebra(R)` for `S in Sets()` with no selected multiplicative/additive structure | `S.free_module(R)` | `Modules(R).Constructors().CombinatorialFreeModule(basis_keys=S)` |

This routing preserves the old Sage functionality without admitting the Sage name as
algebra vocabulary. The true free associative algebra on a set of generators uses
`S.free_algebra(R)` and routes to `free_algebra_from_set`.

## Multiplication Tensor Constructor

The canonical finite-rank algebra constructor is:

```python
Algebras(R).Constructors().from_multiplication_tensor(multiplication=mu)
```

Here `mu` is a `Tensor` in `T_R(M)[1, 2]`. The constructor validates that tensor type and
uses `mu.base_module()` and `mu.parent()` to recover the underlying module and tensor
component. Callers do not pass a separate basis, table, module-element matrix, list of
matrices, or right-multiplication data to `Algebras(R)`. Those shapes belong to
`TensorAlgebraComponents(R).Constructors()`, whose job is to turn coordinate or
module-valued product data into the canonical tensor before algebra construction
begins.

Current implementation status: `from_multiplication_tensor(multiplication=mu)`
validates `mu.tensor_type() == (1, 2)` and that `mu.base_module()` is over the
constructor base ring, then asserts the remaining implementation gap. The missing
surface is a public tensor structure-constant extraction method and a Sage-backed
finite-rank algebra parent constructor from a base module plus the `(1, 2)` tensor.
