# Cat Mapping

This file maps Sage's category and functor machinery to the project `Cat()` subtree.

## Category Objects

Sage `sage.categories.category.Category` instances are the objects of `Cat()`.
For `C = Cat()`, the membership check `X in C` means exactly that `X` is a category
object. A functor is not an object of `Cat()`; it is an element of a functor homset
`A.Hom(B)`.

Consequences:

- Every project top-level category and subcategory should satisfy `C in Cat()`.
- Every category object should get shared category-object operations from
  `Cat.ParentMethods`.
- A homset category is itself a category object, so no separate object-membership
  rule is needed for functor categories.

## Category Order

Sage `Category.is_subcategory(self, c)` is the canonical subcategory relation.

Mapping:

- `C.leq(D)` means `C.is_subcategory(D)`.
- `C.geq(D)` means `D.is_subcategory(C)`.
- `C <= D` and `C >= D` are shorthands for the same relation.
- `Cat().join([C, D, ...])` delegates to Sage `Category.join`.
- `Cat().meet([C, D, ...])` delegates to Sage `Category.meet`, except that the empty
  meet returns `Cat().Constructors().EmptyCategory()`.

This follows Sage's own meaning: `C.is_subcategory(D)` asserts that there is a
natural forgetful functor from `C` to `D`. The comparison shorthands are specified
for ordinary category objects only; `Cat()` itself is the root ambient category in
this spec and does not re-export `leq`, `geq`, `<=`, or `>=`.

## Uniform Category-Object Surface

`Cat.ParentMethods` is the single source of truth for operations every category
object should expose:

- `HomCategory()` / `EndCategory()` / `AutCategory()` for category-level hom, end,
  and aut constructions;
- `Hom(D)` for the object-level functor homspace in `Cat`;
- `leq`, `geq`, `<=`, and `>=` for the Sage category order between ordinary
  category objects;
- containment hooks for categories that need object and morphism membership:
  `_sage_super_categories`, `_sage_object_classes`, and `_sage_morphism_classes`.

Wrapped category instances receive ordinary category-object methods through Sage's
generated classes. The wrapper base layer in `base_category_types.py` is the only
place that flattens `UniversalSubcategoryMethods` into Sage's `SubcategoryMethods`
provider path.

If a subtree already defines the same operation directly on its category class, that
local method takes precedence at runtime and should be treated as a later refactor
target. The Cat-level method remains the canonical specification for category objects.

## Containment

For an arbitrary category object `C`, `X in C` may mean either:

- `X` is an object of `C`; or
- `X` is a morphism in `C`.

For `C = Cat()`, this specializes to category-object membership only. Functor
membership is expressed by the relevant homset:

- `F in A.Hom(B)` for functors `A -> B`;
- `F in A.Hom(A)` for endofunctors of `A`;
- autofunctors are the invertible elements of `A.Hom(A)`.

## Functors

Sage `Functor` instances are morphisms between category objects.

The project surface records Sage's functor call model:

- `_coerce_into_domain(x)`;
- `_apply_functor(x)`;
- `_apply_functor_to_morphism(f)`;
- `__call__(x)` dispatching through those hooks;
- `domain()` and `codomain()`.

Sage construction functors from `sage.categories.pushout` are still actual functors,
but their extra Sage surface is recorded separately: `pushout`, `merge`, `commutes`,
`expand`, `common_base`, and `coercion_reversed`.

This is distinct from Sage `FunctorialConstructionCategory` classes such as
`SubobjectsCategory` or `QuotientsCategory`. Those are category objects produced by
methods like `C.Subobjects()`, not functors with domains, codomains, and object/morphism
actions.

Sage provides no general computable fixed-point operation for arbitrary endofunctors,
so `fixed_points()` is not a Cat-level functor method surface.

## Standard Constructions

Sage functorial construction categories map directly to category-object methods.  A
selector such as `C.HomCategory()` evaluates the corresponding construction functor at
`C`; the return value is the category object `Hom_C`.

| Sage class | Project method | Local file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SubobjectsCategory` | `C.Subobjects()` | `subcategories/constructions/subobjects.py` |
| `QuotientsCategory` | `C.Quotients()` | `subcategories/constructions/quotients.py` |
| `SubquotientsCategory` | `C.Subquotients()` | `subcategories/constructions/subquotients.py` |
| `CartesianProductsCategory` | `C.CartesianProducts()` | `subcategories/constructions/cartesian_products.py` |
| `TensorProductsCategory` | `C.TensorProducts()` where tensor products are defined | `subcategories/constructions/tensor_products.py` |
| `DualObjectsCategory` | `C.DualObjects()` where dual objects are defined | `subcategories/constructions/dual_objects.py` |
| `IsomorphicObjectsCategory` | `C.IsomorphicObjects()` where isomorphic-object transport is defined | `subcategories/constructions/isomorphic_objects.py` |
| Local slice construction | `C.ObjectsOver(T)` | `subcategories/constructions/objects_over.py` |
| Local coslice construction | `C.ObjectsUnder(T)` | `subcategories/constructions/objects_under.py` |
| `HomsetsCategory` | `C.HomCategory()` | `homsets.py` |
| `HomsetsCategory.Endset()` | `C.EndCategory()` | `endsets.py` |
| `HomsetsCategory.Autset()` | `C.AutCategory()` | `autsets.py` |
| `JoinCategory` | `Cat().JoinCategories()` containment | `join_categories.py` |

The universal selectors for `Subobjects`, `Quotients`, `Subquotients`,
`ObjectsOver`, `ObjectsUnder`, and `CartesianProducts` live in
`universal_subcategory_methods.py`. Other standard construction names, such as
`TensorProducts()` and `DualObjects()`, are exposed by the subtrees where the
mathematics is available. Individual category classes still declare their construction
classes, and Sage's `category_of(...)` machinery resolves the specific construction
for the receiver.

For wrapped ordinary category objects, `C.Hom(D)` delegates to Sage's parent homspace
for functors `C -> D`. The category-level construction is `C.HomCategory()`. The
object-level endomorphism functor space is `C.Hom(C)`.

For `Cat()`, `Subobjects` means subcategories, `Quotients` means quotient
categories, `Subquotients` means category-level subquotients, and
`CartesianProducts` means product categories.

## Slice and Coslice Categories

Sage does not provide a dedicated installed class for categories over or under a
fixed category in the same way it provides `SubobjectsCategory` and
`QuotientsCategory`. The local mapping is:

- `C.ObjectsOver(T)` means categories `D` equipped with a structure functor
  `D -> T`;
- `C.ObjectsUnder(T)` means categories `D` equipped with a structure functor
  `T -> D`;
- `Slice = ObjectsOver`;
- `Coslice = ObjectsUnder`.

These classes use Sage's `RegressiveCovariantConstructionCategory` plus
`Category_over_base`, so they follow the same `category_of(...)` entry point as
Sage's built-in regressive constructions.

## Hom, End, and Aut Categories

`CatHomCategory` is the category of functor categories internal to `Cat()`.  The
functorial construction is `Hom_*: Cat -> Cat`, which sends a category `C` to the
category object `Hom_C`.

Mapping:

- `C.HomCategory()` is the category-level functorial construction whose objects are
  `Hom_C(A, B)` for objects `A, B` of `C`;
- `C.HomCategory().Of(A, B)` is `Hom_C(A, B)`;
- `Cat().HomCategory()` is therefore the category of functor categories;
- `A.Hom(B)` returns Sage's `Hom(A, B, category=Cat())` parent when `A` and `B`
  are category objects;
- `A.Hom(B).category()` is `Cat().HomCategory()`;
- `A.Hom(A)` is the object-level endofunctor parent;
- hom elements are Sage `Functor` instances;
- Sage `ConstructionFunctor` instances have a specialized functor method surface; they
  are not the same object as the construction-category value `Hom_C`.

The repository-level `homsets/` subtree owns generic hom/end/aut vocabulary such as
`domain`, `codomain`, `EndCategory`, and `AutCategory`. The Cat subtree adds only the
functor-specific element surface and the `CatHomCategory`, `CatEndCategory`, and
`CatAutCategory` refinements. These live in separate files:
`cat/homsets.py`, `cat/endsets.py`, and `cat/autsets.py`.

## Constructors

`Cat().Constructors()` owns category-object constructor entry points. It currently
exposes:

- `EmptyCategory()`: the bottom category object used by `Cat().meet([])` and by any
  surface that needs the empty category as a category object.

It also exposes constructor discoverability without moving constructor ownership:

- `Aggregate()`: a runtime collector over zero-parameter top-level constructor
  namespaces, currently `Cat()`, `Sets()`, `Posets()`, `Rings()`, and
  `TopologicalSpaces()`.
- `AggregateFor(named_categories)`: a collector over explicit `(prefix, category)`
  pairs, used when the constructor namespace is parameterized by data such as a base
  ring.

Aggregate names are deterministic: the category prefix and constructor method name are
joined by an underscore. For example,
`Posets().Constructors().poset_from_digraph(...)` is exposed as
`Cat().Constructors().Aggregate().posets_poset_from_digraph(...)`. The aggregate also
provides `names()` for discoverability. This is instance-level binding of existing
constructor callables, not class splicing, Sage method-provider manipulation, or a new
owner for the constructors.

Ordinary category objects are registered by being Sage/project `Category` instances.
Functors are registered by being Sage `Functor` or `ConstructionFunctor` instances and
by lying in the relevant functor homset.
