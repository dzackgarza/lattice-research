# Implement involution eigenlattices

## Summary

Leaf implementation card derived from the old phase plan. This card is executable only after `PHASE-LATTICE-05-ORTHOGONAL-GROUPS-ROOTS-WEYL-EICHLER-AND-COXETER` is approved.

## Source Provenance

- `plans/PHASE_5_ORTHOGONAL_GROUPS.md`
- Source section: Step 5.4: Involution Eigenlattices
- Parent plan: `PHASE-LATTICE-05-ORTHOGONAL-GROUPS-ROOTS-WEYL-EICHLER-AND-COXETER`
- Program plan: `PLAN-CATEGORY-SPEC-PROGRAM`

## Source-Grounded Contract

Source anchors: `pln-lattice-phase-5-orthogonal-groups.md` (Step 5.4), `category-abc-spec.md`, and `theory/spec_backups/lattices_written_spec_backup.py`.

- `L.invariant_sublattice(g)` contract:
  - Defined for involution `g ∈ O(L)` as `ker(g - id)` and expressed via kernel on hom-space.
  - Hypothesis: `g^2 = id`; precondition for interpretation as invariant part.
- `L.coinvariant_sublattice(g)` contract:
  - Defined as `ker(g + id)` (−1-eigenspace lattice in free module terms).
  - Expectation: in hyperbolic rank-2 examples `coinvariant = invariant.perp()` when form is nondegenerate.
- Return objects are lattices with inherited forms (subobject kernels with restricted form).
- These are lattice-level methods on `Lattice` with subobject semantics, not matrix operators.
- Compatibility checks must use morphism arithmetic only (`g + id`, `g - id`) and kernel construction from morphism category.

Backend routing:
- Kernel/inclusion computations are category-algebraic local operations on hom-objects.
- Any downstream group-order computations from these sublattices are delegated according to backend map (finite exact / indefinite split).

## Context

This card exists because the old phase document mixed high-level planning with executable substeps. The migration splits that material into a phase plan plus leaf cards so an implementation agent can work from one bounded contract.

Target boundary: `src/lattices/groups/orthogonal.py`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Read the cited source section before implementation.
- [ ] Keep changes inside the named target boundary unless a new card or decision expands scope.
- [ ] Preserve the mathematical semantics from the source plan and category-spec style rules.
- [ ] Record validation commands and results before handoff.
- [ ] Do not mark this card done without human approval.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

Do not execute before the parent phase plan is approved and prerequisite phase cards are resolved. If the source section reveals missing vocabulary or method ownership, stop and file a decision or spec card instead of patching around it.

## Work Log

- Created by corpus-level `plans/` migration on 2026-05-03.
