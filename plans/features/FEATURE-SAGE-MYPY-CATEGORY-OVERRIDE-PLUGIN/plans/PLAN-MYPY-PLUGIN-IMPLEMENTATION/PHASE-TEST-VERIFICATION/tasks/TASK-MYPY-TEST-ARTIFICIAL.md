# Task: Create Test Fixtures

## Summary

Create 11 artificial Sage category files under `tests/fixtures/` that cover
every row in the spec test matrix.

## Context

Each fixture is a minimal `.py` file defining category classes using Sage's
category machinery. The mypy plugin will type-check these files during tests.

The fixtures must be self-contained: they import Sage's `Category` base class
and define their own hierarchy without depending on specific Sage built-in
categories.

## Source Provenance

- `SPEC-SAGE-MYPY-CATEGORY-OVERRIDE`: Test matrix (11 rows)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Fixture files import and run under Sage without errors
- Each fixture exercises exactly one test case
- Fixtures don't depend on specific Sage version categories
- Files are readable and well-commented

## Work Log

- Reopened 2026-05-10 after confirming that the existing fixtures prove only the
  Sage-prefixed namespace path and therefore do not encode the intended
  third-party subtree use case.
- Updated 2026-05-10: added a parallel `third_party_pkg.categories` fixture tree
  with valid and invalid override cases outside `sage.categories.*`.

## Current Status

Needs review. The fixture set now includes explicit non-Sage subtree coverage in
addition to the Sage-prefixed matrix.
