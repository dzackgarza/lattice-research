# Decide whether to approve the phase-01 plan tree and first execution lane

## Summary

The organized phase-01 plan tree is now connected, every active task-like card points
to a leaf plan, and the next execution move requires human approval of the plan spine
or an explicit revision request.

## Source Provenance

- `.agents/current-goal-phase.md` identifies the active phase as category specs and
  semantic vocabulary.
- `plans/features/FEATURE-CATEGORY-SPECS-AND-SAGE-SURFACES/FEATURE-CATEGORY-SPECS-AND-SAGE-SURFACES.md` records the
  phase objective and exit criteria.
- `.agents/visuals/category-spec-plan-hierarchy.mmd` records the current plan
  dependency tree.
- `research-state-machine` and `category-spec-workflow` require complex plans to be
  approved before decomposition or execution.

## Context

The repo gradients make the first execution lane mostly forced: category foundation
work precedes Sage admission work; Sage admission precedes lattice and geometry
interfaces; the lattice plan itself is sequential from phase 0 through phase 5.

The non-obvious decision is not the local ordering inside that gradient. The decision is
whether the human accepts the organized phase-01 plan tree as the operative plan, wants
specific revisions before execution, or wants phase-01 execution held.

## Decision

Zack approved all existing plans on 2026-05-03. This removes the approval gate from
the phase-00 and phase-01 plan artifacts that were waiting on human approval.

Downstream phase plans that were already `blocked` remain blocked by the staged
program dependency order in `GOAL.md`; their block is not an approval gap.

## Options

- Approve the phase-01 plan tree and begin with the foundation lane:
  `PLAN-STATIC-CATEGORY-REFINEMENT-ORDER`, `PLAN-HOM-END-AUT-STRUCTURAL-ADMISSION`, `PHASE-CATEGORY-OBJECT-SURFACE-UNIFORMIZATION-AND-CONSTRUCTOR-AGGREGATION`, and
  `PHASE-MODULE-WRAPPER-MIGRATION-AND-CATEGORY-GRAPH-COVERAGE`.
- Revise the plan tree before approval, naming the plan IDs or workstreams that need a
  different parent, scope, or execution order.
- Hold phase-01 execution blocked and restrict agents to metadata, validation, and
  decision-card maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The selected option is recorded in `chosen` or the body of this decision card.
- [x] If approved, the affected plan statuses move from `needs-approval` only with
  human approval.
- [ ] If revised, the plan files and dependency visual are updated together.
- [ ] If held, active execution cards remain unstarted and the blocking reason is
  visible from this card.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

- Do not treat this card as approval by itself.
- Do not execute implementation or spec cards under `needs-approval` plans.
- Do not create a parallel backlog or execution list outside `.agents`.
- Existing lower-level decision cards remain scoped to their own leaf plans.

## Work Log

- 2026-05-03: Created to make the phase-01 approval gate durable instead of leaving it
  only in chat.
- 2026-05-03: Recorded Zack's approval and marked existing `needs-approval` plans
  as approved.
