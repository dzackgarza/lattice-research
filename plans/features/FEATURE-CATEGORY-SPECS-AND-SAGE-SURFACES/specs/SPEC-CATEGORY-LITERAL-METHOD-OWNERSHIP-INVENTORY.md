title: Specify literal method ownership inventory by minimal category
status: needs-review
priority: critical
requirement: Produce source-grounded method ownership spec files that enumerate every
  literal mathematical or software-facing method expected on category-spec objects
  and state the minimal subcategory that introduces each method.
acceptanceCriteria:
- Every admitted method row names the literal surface spelling, minimal owner category,
  mathematical definition or software interop meaning, hypotheses, codomain or return
  object, and source paths.
- Root-set methods, finite-set protocol methods such as `len(X)`, countable/enumerated
  methods, subobject operations, topology/metric methods, algebra/module methods,
  Hom/End/Aut methods, forms/lattice methods, tensor methods, poset methods, and geometry/backend
  methods are all inventoried or explicitly rejected with source provenance.
- External software mappings from Sage, Oscar/Julia, GAP, Singular, Macaulay2, CARAT,
  Indefinite.jl, and related local backend notes are represented as method rows or
  backend-routing rows rather than left in prose.
- Unresolved method-owner conflicts become decision cards with exact sources checked
  and no implementation task is allowed to guess a mathematical owner.

# Specify literal method ownership inventory by minimal category

## Summary

Produce one or more trackable spec files that list the literal expected methods on
category-spec objects and record where each method first becomes mathematically valid.
The output is an ownership inventory, not an implementation pass. It exists so later
code and smoke work can ask "which category introduces this method?" without relying on
Sage implementation class names, wrapper inheritance, or generic LLM guesses.

## Required Row Format

Each method row must record:

- literal surface spelling, including Python protocol spelling where relevant;
- object level: category object, parent, element, hom parent, hom element, constructor,
  or backend bridge;
- minimal introducing category or construction owner;
- inherited or refined categories that should receive the method automatically;
- mathematical definition, invariant, or software interop meaning;
- hypotheses required for the method to make sense;
- codomain or return object, including whether it is a scalar, ideal, subobject, set,
  morphism, group, tensor, ring, module, polyhedron, sheaf, or backend payload;
- source paths and source sections reviewed;
- decision status: admitted, rejected, interop-only, deferred, or decision-needed;
- downstream implementation, test, smoke, or audit card if one already exists.
- diagnostic-warning obligation, when the method has mathematically correct behavior
  that users are likely to misread because of Sage convention, degenerate hypotheses,
  dual-object notation, quotient/value-codomain conventions, or another documented
  surprise.

## Global Category Diagnostics

The category system must have a single global diagnostic flag for opt-in background
logging of mathematically important surprises, nuances, and convention boundaries. It
is disabled by default. Enabling it must not change return values, weaken validation,
replace exceptions, or become a hidden control path; it only permits implementations to
emit explanatory warnings through the category-spec logging channel.

The implementation surface is admitted as a category-system configuration surface, not
as a method on every category object:

| Literal surface | Object level | Minimal owner | Meaning, codomain, and hypotheses | Status and source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `category_diagnostics_enabled()` | category-system configuration | `category_specs.utils` | Return whether opt-in category diagnostics are enabled for this process. Disabled by default. | Admitted. Source: user directive on 2026-05-06; `[[SPEC-MAPPING-CAT]]`. |
| `set_category_diagnostics_enabled(enabled)` | category-system configuration | `category_specs.utils` | Set the process-local diagnostic flag. Must not change mathematical behavior, validation, dispatch, containment, coercion, or refinement. | Admitted. Source: user directive on 2026-05-06; `[[SPEC-MAPPING-CAT]]`. |
| `enable_category_diagnostics()` / `disable_category_diagnostics()` | category-system configuration | `category_specs.utils` | Explicitly toggle opt-in category diagnostic logging for the process. | Admitted. Source: user directive on 2026-05-06; `[[SPEC-MAPPING-CAT]]`. |
| `emit_category_diagnostic(message, *, key=None, once=True)` | category-system logging | `category_specs.utils` | Emit a category diagnostic warning only when the global flag is enabled; optional keys suppress repeated warnings without changing return values. | Admitted. Source: user directive on 2026-05-06; `[[SPEC-MAPPING-CAT]]`. |
| `category_diagnostic_logger()` | category-system logging | `category_specs.utils` | Return the logger named `category_specs.diagnostics`; callers do not configure global logging. | Admitted. Source: user directive on 2026-05-06; `[[SPEC-MAPPING-CAT]]`. |
| diagnostic warning docstring clause | method-definition documentation | every method whose correct behavior has source-grounded surprise conditions | The method docstring must name the exact conditions under which an implementation should emit a diagnostic warning when the global flag is enabled. | Admitted. Source: user directive on 2026-05-06. |

Examples of warning-bearing methods:

- `L.dual_lattice()` / lattice-side `dual()` compatibility: if `L` is degenerate or
  if the name `dual()` would invite confusion between metric dual `L^#` and Hom dual
  `Hom_R(L,R)`, the docstring should say that the enabled diagnostic warns which
  object is being returned and why.
- quotient-valued discriminant forms: if a value lives in `K/R` or `K/2R`, the
  docstring should say that the enabled diagnostic may warn when a backend computes by
  lifting to `K` but the public value remains quotient-valued.
- Sage-interop aliases whose Sage name carries narrower or historically misleading
  semantics must document when the enabled diagnostic should point to the project
  mathematical name.

## Seed Method Surfaces

These seed surfaces are not the final inventory. They are the minimum prompts that the
execution tasks must resolve against source files.

- Sets: `__contains__`, `an_element`, `some_elements`, `cardinality`, `is_empty`,
  `is_finite`, `subsets`, `subsets_lattice`, `union`, comparison and subset protocol,
  `free_module`, `free_algebra`, `_sympy_`.

  support methods, `submodule`, `span`, `quotient_module`, `intersection`,
  `saturation`, `dual`, `tensor`, `hom`, basis-defined morphisms, kernel, image,
  cokernel.

  Hodge invariants, canonical classes, genus, normalization, monodromy, orbit,
  stabilizer, embedding, isometry, and discriminant-form methods.

## Assembly Index And Follow-Up Links

Assembly task: `TASK-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-SPEC-ASSEMBLY`.

The inventory is assembled as one trackable spec file rather than split into sibling
spec files. The single-file structure keeps duplicate literal method names visible
across mathematical owners while preserving topic sections for review.

Rows use the following normalized fields, with topic-specific wording only where a
backend or candidate geometry row needs an extra routing/status phrase:

- literal or source surface;
- object level;
- minimal or candidate owner category;
- meaning, codomain, hypotheses, or backend route;
- status and source path.

| Section | Source task | Follow-up links |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Set topology and metric method rows | `TASK-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-SETS-TOPOLOGY` | `DECISION-20260505-REALSET-SAGE-TOPOLOGICAL-AXIOM-WARNING`, `SPEC-20260505-PARTITIONED-FINITE-TOTALLY-ORDERED-BASE-OWNER` |
| Ring algebra and module method rows | `TASK-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-ALGEBRA-MODULES` | q-adic Sage-gap rows route through existing q-adic constructor specs and implementation cards; formed divisibility is explicitly delegated to the Hom/forms/lattice section. |
| Hom forms and lattice method rows | `TASK-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-HOM-FORMS-LATTICES` | `DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-MALFORMED-BACKEND-SURFACES` for malformed backend names; lattice algorithm rows point to backend-routing rows rather than local implementation permission. |
| Poset tensor and geometry-facing method rows | `TASK-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-POSETS-TENSORS-GEOMETRY` | `DECISION-01KQN9J3XCYW748M5V0K2SGJGK-DECIDE-WHETHER-EQUIVALENCE-RELATIONS-AND-SET-PARTITIONS-NEED-A-FIRST-CLA`, `DECISION-01KQN9YGCTP85RXF1F56D8S08X-DECIDE-WHETHER-PARTITIONED-SET-COMBINATORIAL-SUBCLASSES-SUCH-AS-NONCROSS`, `DECISION-01KQN9YGCVRR84SHX4DR1K284C-DECIDE-WHETHER-TENSOR-SYMMETRY-ANTISYMMETRY-AND-CONTRACTION-NEED-ADMITTE`, `DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-PICARD-GROUP-LATTICE-OWNER`, `PLAN-GEOMETRIC-SOURCE-ADMISSION`, `PLAN-CURVE-COMPLEMENT-MONODROMY-BACKENDS` |
| Backend and external software method rows | `TASK-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-BACKEND-MAPPING` | `DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-MALFORMED-BACKEND-SURFACES`, `DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-PICARD-GROUP-LATTICE-OWNER`; backend-gap rows route through `.agents/memories/theory/backends/software-capability-map.md` and existing backend research cards. |
| Gap audit | `TASK-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-GAP-AUDIT` | Records the remaining decision/source/back-end gaps below and marks the phase review-ready without relying on global QC. |

## Gap Audit Routing

This audit is source and owner routing only. It does not approve implementation of any
candidate geometry or backend method.

| Gap class | Searched | Found | Conclusion | Confidence | Gaps | Trackable owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Geometry candidate rows needing owners, hypotheses, or codomains: `blowup(center)`, `resolve_singularities()`, `kodaira_dimension()`, `hilbert_polynomial()`, `hodge_number(p,q)`, `holomorphic_euler_characteristic()`, `canonical_class()`, curve, surface, divisor, sheaf, cover, and family rows. | `.agents/memories/theory/backends/abstract-to-external-mapping.md`; `plans/features/FEATURE-GEOMETRY-CATEGORY-INTERFACES/**`; `theory/foundations/coble-task-background.md`; `theory/foundations/reflective-two-elementary-lattices.md`. | Backend-method names and local Coble/K3 source motivation are present; admitted category owners for the generic geometry nouns are delegated to source-admission cards. | Inference: these rows are useful inventory entries, but they are not implementation permission until the corresponding geometry source-admission task fixes the owner and codomain. | High | Upstream geometry/Sage/Macaulay2/Singular source mining belongs in the listed source-admission cards. | `TASK-INTEGRATE-SCHEMES-CATEGORY`, `TASK-INTEGRATE-VARIETIES-CATEGORY`, `TASK-INTEGRATE-COMPLEX-VARIETIES-CATEGORY`, `TASK-INTEGRATE-COMPLEX-ALGEBRAIC-CURVES-CATEGORY`, `TASK-INTEGRATE-COMPLEX-ALGEBRAIC-SURFACES-CATEGORY`, `TASK-INTEGRATE-FAMILIES-OF-VARIETIES-CATEGORY`, `TASK-RESEARCH-PICARD-FUCHS-MONODROMY-JNF-FAMILIES`, `TASK-RESEARCH-ORE-ALGEBRA-INTERFACE`. |
| Picard group versus Picard lattice. | `.agents/memories/theory/backends/abstract-to-external-mapping.md`; `theory/foundations/reflective-two-elementary-lattices.md`; `theory/foundations/coble-task-background.md`; `theory/references/literature/pieroni_2026_coble_surfaces.md`; `theory/references/literature/huybrechts_k3_lectures.md`. | Strong local source material exists for Picard lattices in Coble/K3 surface workflows, while `picard_group()` is a more general Picard group surface in the backend map and literature. | Inference: the two notions must remain separate until a decision records the bridge hypotheses and method owners. | High | Geometry source-admission tasks still need to fix the project nouns for `PicardGroup` and `PicardLattices`. | `DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-PICARD-GROUP-LATTICE-OWNER`; malformed spelling remains under `DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-MALFORMED-BACKEND-SURFACES`. |
| Backend `bridge-needed` or `candidate-backend` rows. | `.agents/memories/theory/backends/software-capability-map.md`; `.agents/memories/theory/backends/abstract-to-external-mapping.md`; `.agents/memories/theory/backends/oscar-lattices.md`; `.agents/memories/theory/backends/gap-orbits.md`; `.agents/memories/theory/backends/indefinite-jl.md`; `.agents/memories/theory/backends/carat.md`; `.agents/memories/theory/backends/vinberg-algorithm.md`; geometry and lattice backend tracker cards. | Each row has a mature-system route or an explicit candidate/backend-gap label; malformed names are isolated in a decision card. | Inference: these are backend-routing gaps for later implementation and support audits, not blockers for the current method-owner spec phase. | High | Each implementation card must still verify package availability, exact hypotheses, and certificates before code work. | Lattice rows route to `PHASE-LATTICE-05-ORTHOGONAL-GROUPS-ROOTS-WEYL-EICHLER-AND-COXETER` tasks; q-adic rows route to `SPEC-01KQN9YGC4WXF1DVHNMF79ZXEM-PRESERVE-ADMITTED-ZQWITHPRECISIONCAPS-AND-QQWITHPRECISIONCAPS-NAMES-AS-D` and `TASK-01KQN9YGCQA3E2Y2RAMA2EHZPR-RESEARCH-UPSTREAM-SAGE-SUPPORT-OR-ISSUES-FOR-Q-ADIC-UNRAMIFIED-EXTENSION`; geometry rows route to `PLAN-GEOMETRIC-SOURCE-ADMISSION` and `PLAN-CURVE-COMPLEMENT-MONODROMY-BACKENDS`. |

Unblocked current-phase paths: implementation and smoke-spec cards may use the
admitted method-owner rows for sets/topology, rings/algebras/modules, Hom/End/Aut,
forms, lattices, tensor components, posets, and backend routing as source-grounded
inventory. Geometry candidate rows, Picard bridge rows, malformed backend names, and
explicit Sage-gap frontiers remain blocked only for their own downstream implementation
paths.

## Set Topology And Metric Method Rows

Source task: `TASK-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-SETS-TOPOLOGY`.

These rows cover the first-pass admitted, rejected, or deferred set/topology surfaces.
They are source-grounded in `category_specs/sets/docs/SAGE_INVENTORY.md`,
`category_specs/sets/docs/MAPPING.md`,
`category_specs/topological_spaces/docs/SAGE_INVENTORY.md`, and
`category_specs/topological_spaces/docs/MAPPING.md`.

### Geometry-Facing Candidate Rows

These geometry rows record candidate source owners and codomains so backend work does
not invent method placement. They do not admit geometry implementation. The geometry
feature explicitly keeps this work research-scoped until category ownership is
source-grounded in its own cards.

| Literal surface | Object level | Candidate owner | Meaning, codomain, and hypotheses | Status and source |

## Backend And External Software Method Rows

Source task: `TASK-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-BACKEND-MAPPING`.

These rows translate `.agents/memories/theory/backends/abstract-to-external-mapping.md` through the
routing statuses in `.agents/memories/theory/backends/software-capability-map.md`. A backend row never
approves bespoke local mathematics. It says which semantic project object should own the
method and which mature external system should be audited or wired.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PicardGroup.intersection_matrix()` | Source spelling maps to the project construction `PicardLattice.intersection_matrix()` after the surface/Picard bridge constructs a `PicardLattice`; arbitrary `PicardGroup` does not own this method. | Oscar `gram_matrix`; `bridge-needed` after divisor classes and intersection pairing are known. | Source: abstract map and `[[DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-PICARD-GROUP-LATTICE-OWNER]]`. |
| `PicardeLattice.underlying_picard_group()` | Rejected malformed source spelling; do not expose this literal public API. Corrected public bridge is `PicardLattice.underlying_picard_group()` returning the source `PicardGroup` plus construction provenance. | Source-map coverage only; no implementation permission for malformed spelling. | Source: abstract map, `[[DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-MALFORMED-BACKEND-SURFACES]]`, and `[[DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-PICARD-GROUP-LATTICE-OWNER]]`. |

Do not force CARAT onto indefinite input. |
| `Lattice.isometry_test()` | isometry predicate between formed modules/lattices; codomain is `bool` plus optional isometry witness. | Indefinite.jl `test_equivalence`; `bridge-needed`. | Sources: abstract map and `indefinite-jl.md`. |
| `Lattice.orbit_representatives()` | orthogonal-group or subgroup action surface; codomain is representatives with stabilizer/certificate data when needed. | Indefinite.jl `get_orbit_representative`; `candidate-backend`. | Sources: abstract map, `indefinite-jl.md`, orbit backend notes. |
| `Lattice.vinberg_sh姚()` | rejected malformed source spelling; no direct replacement literal is admitted from this row. | Source-map coverage only; future Vinberg surfaces must be named by mathematical output such as simple roots, Coxeter matrix, Gram matrix, and control-vector/chamber data. | Sources: abstract map, `.agents/memories/theory/backends/vinberg-algorithm.md`, Oscar Vinberg notes, and `[[DECISION-CATEGORY-METHOD-INVENTORY-MALFORMED-BACKEND-SURFACES]]`. Public API belongs in Phase 05 lattice/Coxeter cards; bespoke implementation is not approved. |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Every admitted method row names the literal surface spelling, minimal owner category, mathematical definition or software interop meaning, hypotheses, codomain or return object, and source paths.
- [x] Root-set methods, finite-set protocol methods such as `len(X)`, countable/enumerated methods, subobject operations, topology/metric methods, algebra/module methods, Hom/End/Aut methods, forms/lattice methods, tensor methods, poset methods, and geometry/backend methods are all inventoried or explicitly rejected with source provenance.
- [x] External software mappings from Sage, Oscar/Julia, GAP, Singular, Macaulay2, CARAT, Indefinite.jl, and related local backend notes are represented as method rows or backend-routing rows rather than left in prose.
- [x] Unresolved method-owner conflicts become decision cards with exact sources checked and no implementation task is allowed to guess a mathematical owner.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

- This spec is owned by `PLAN-CATEGORY-FOUNDATION-KERNEL` and executed through
  `PHASE-CATEGORY-LITERAL-METHOD-INVENTORY-AND-OWNERSHIP`.
- Do not create implementation cards from a method name until the method row has a
  minimal owner, hypotheses, and codomain.
- Do not treat Sage implementation inheritance as mathematical ownership. The same
  Sage class may witness methods owned by sets, modules, forms, Hom categories, or
  backend interop.
- Do not merge distinct meanings under one method name unless a source-grounded proof
  or decision card states the equivalence hypotheses.
- Backend algorithm rows route through mature software first; use the backend-routing
  labels from `.agents/memories/theory/backends/software-capability-map.md`.
