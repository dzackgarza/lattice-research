successCriteria:

- Relevant smoke output is updated in this task body or a linked tracker item, with
  exact failing surfaces preserved when work remains.
- The change uses project category vocabulary rather than Sage fallback helper names
  or wrapper-only categories.
- When implementing a set item, cite the exact mapping row and prove behavior through
  project category vocabulary.
- Do not expose generic Sage Set(X) as a public project constructor.

# Implement fixed-base SetPartitions constructor refinements into Sets().Partitioned() and keep AllSetPartitions countable-only
## Summary

Sets mapping is the source of truth for set constructors, rich comparison, partitioned
sets, ImageSets, Primes version skew, RealSet routing, and set/hom/end/aut ownership.

## Source Provenance

- `category_specs/sets/docs/MAPPING.md`
- Original migrated line: `Implement fixed-base SetPartitions constructor refinements into Sets().Partitioned() and keep AllSetPartitions countable-only from category_specs/sets/docs/MAPPING.md`

## Context

- ImageSets are image subobjects and must expose ambient, lift, and retract surface.
- Fixed-base SetPartitions(s) refines through Sets().Partitioned(); all finite partitions without a fixed base remain countable-only.
- Set rich comparison is set-theoretic inclusion and equality, not Sage wrapper comparison behavior.
- Partitioned-set predicates such as crossings, nestings, noncrossing, nonnesting, and atomic are mapped for future axiomatic subcategory admission.
- Primes documentation and installed source are version-skewed; congruence-class prime subsets need further evidence before admission.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The implementation changes only the scoped category-spec surface and does not weaken smokes or mapping decisions to make failures disappear.
- [x] Relevant smoke output is updated in this task body or a linked tracker item, with exact failing surfaces preserved when work remains.
- [x] The change uses project category vocabulary rather than Sage fallback helper names or wrapper-only categories.
- [x] When implementing a set item, cite the exact mapping row and prove behavior through project category vocabulary.
- [x] Do not expose generic Sage Set(X) as a public project constructor.

## Implementation Result

- Registered the set-partition axioms `Partitioned` and `FiniteTotallyOrderedBase` in
  `category_specs/axioms.py`.
- Made `Sets().Partitioned().FiniteTotallyOrderedBase()` reachable as the scoped
  subcategory method from `PartitionedSetsCategory`.
- Centralized fixed-base `SetPartitions` refinement categories in
  `Sets.Constructors._set_partitions_categories(...)`.
- Kept `Sets().Constructors().AllSetPartitions()` refined only through `Sets()` and
  `Sets().Countable()`.
- Refined the Sage integer fixed-base routes `SetPartitions(3)`,
  `SetPartitionsWithBlockCount(3, 2)`, and
  `SetPartitionsWithBlockSizes(3, [2, 1])` into
  `Sets().Partitioned().FiniteTotallyOrderedBase()` because Sage's integer route has
  the standard finite ordered base `{1, ..., n}`. Iterable routes remain only
  `Sets().Partitioned()` and do not use raw Python ordering as category evidence.

## Validation Notes

- `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed with
  the pre-existing Sage inherited `Sets.Topological` warning.
- `just --justfile category_specs/justfile check-abstract-redefinitions` passed.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

- Keep `SAGE_INVENTORY.md` and `MAPPING.md` as the source and mapping provenance; do not recreate subtree-local `TRIAGE.md` files.
- If execution reveals a missing mathematical owner, constructor, or category graph edge, split that as a new tracker item instead of patching around it.
- Preserve the original source path in updates so future agents can trace why this item exists.

## Work Log

- Created by migration repair from inline tracker item to full-document Nimbalyst task.
- 2026-05-05: Implemented the fixed-base partition refinement route, added smoke
  assertions proving `AllSetPartitions()` is not fixed-base `Partitioned`, and proved
  integer fixed-base partition constructors refine through
  `Sets().Partitioned().FiniteTotallyOrderedBase()`.
