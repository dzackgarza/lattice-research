# Research local Sage poset import failure and complete import-level category introspection for semilattice evidence
## Summary

The deleted Posets triage recorded settled order-theoretic mapping items, a concrete
design decision about equivalence relations/set partitions, and evidence gaps around
semilattice category introspection.

## Source Provenance

- The migrated recovery path `category_specs/posets/docs/TRIAGE.md` is stale.
  The deleted triage file actually lived at
  `plans/category_specs/posets/docs/TRIAGE.md`; recover exact prior content with
  `git show 8d1c21c^:plans/category_specs/posets/docs/TRIAGE.md`.
- Original migrated line: `Research local Sage poset import failure and complete import-level category introspection for semilattice evidence from category_specs/posets/docs/TRIAGE.md`

## Context

- Poset constructors are named non-variadic adaptations; acyclic DiGraph is the canonical finite-poset constructor.
- Meet and join expose binary operations plus sequence folds, not optional-argument aggregate signatures.
- Lattice congruences use set-theoretic vocabulary: EquivalenceRelation and SetPartition, with congruence_generated_by(blocks).
- certificate=True Sage paths map to separately named witness-returning certificate methods.
- Sage semilattice category evidence is local: installed Sage exposes concrete meet-
  and join-semilattice constructors, but no dedicated semilattice category modules or
  runtime semilattice category refinement.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The research result cites the exact sources searched and separates source evidence from inference.
- [x] Negative findings use the repository five-field format: Searched, Found, Conclusion, Confidence, Gaps.
- [x] Any admitted design consequence is linked to a spec-work or design-decision item rather than buried in prose.
- [x] Run just smoke-file posets/smoketest.sage after poset constructor or method changes.
- [x] Use the five-field negative-finding format for further Sage semilattice evidence gaps.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

- Keep `SAGE_INVENTORY.md` and `MAPPING.md` as the source and mapping provenance; do not recreate subtree-local `TRIAGE.md` files.
- If execution reveals a missing mathematical owner, constructor, or category graph edge, split that as a new tracker item instead of patching around it.
- Preserve the original source path in updates so future agents can trace why this item exists.

## Work Log

- Created by migration repair from inline tracker item to full-document Nimbalyst task.
- 2026-05-05: Broadened the stale migrated triage path after
  `git show 8d1c21c^:category_specs/posets/docs/TRIAGE.md` failed. The
  recoverable archived file is
  `plans/category_specs/posets/docs/TRIAGE.md` at `8d1c21c^`.
- 2026-05-05: Completed import-level Sage category introspection for the
  installed Sage 10.7 environment.

  - Searched: local Sage category directory
    `/home/dzack/miniforge3/envs/sage/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sage/categories`;
    `sage -python` `importlib.util.find_spec(...)` for
    `sage.categories.meet_semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.join_semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.finite_meet_semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.finite_join_semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.semilattices`, and
    `sage.categories.finite_semilattices`; `sage -c` imports of
    `sage.categories.posets.Posets`, `FinitePosets`, `LatticePosets`, and
    `FiniteLatticePosets`; `sage -c` construction of `MeetSemilattice(...)`
    and `JoinSemilattice(...)`.
  - Found: only `posets.py`, `finite_posets.py`, `lattice_posets.py`, and
    `finite_lattice_posets.py` exist as relevant Sage category modules.
    `importlib.util.find_spec(...)` returned `None` for every semilattice
    category module name above. `sage -c` imports of the four poset/lattice
    category modules succeeded. Concrete Sage `MeetSemilattice(...)` and
    `JoinSemilattice(...)` objects report category
    `Category of facade finite enumerated posets`, not a dedicated Sage
    semilattice category.
  - Conclusion: Inference: this installed Sage environment has concrete finite
    meet- and join-semilattice classes, but no dedicated Sage semilattice
    category modules or runtime semilattice category refinement. The project
    semilattice categories therefore need to remain repo-owned wrappers over
    Sage concrete classes and finite-poset/lattice evidence.
  - Confidence: High for the installed Sage 10.7 environment.
  - Gaps: I did not audit remote Sage documentation or unreleased Sage source;
    this card is scoped to the local installed Sage category evidence.

  - Searched: `sage -python` imports of
    `sage.categories.posets.Posets`, `sage.categories.finite_posets.FinitePosets`,
    `sage.categories.lattice_posets.LatticePosets`,
    `sage.categories.finite_lattice_posets.FiniteLatticePosets`, and
    `sage.combinat.posets.lattices`.
  - Found: `sage -python` still fails during Sage category initialization with
    `ImportError: cannot import name Category`, while equivalent `sage -c`
    imports and the repo `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file
    posets/smoketest.sage` path succeed.
  - Conclusion: Inference: the historical import failure is specific to the
    `sage -python` entry point in this environment/session and is not a live
    blocker for source-backed category-spec smokes or Sage `sage -c`
    introspection.
  - Confidence: Medium.
  - Gaps: I did not debug Sage's `sage -python` bootstrap because the category
    evidence needed for this card was recoverable through `sage -c`, local
    source files, and the passing poset smoke.

- 2026-05-05 validation: `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file
  posets/smoketest.sage` passed after the linked constructor/certificate fixes
  in commit `c74860e`.

- 2026-05-07: Refreshed the local Sage evidence. The historical `sage -python`
  category-initialization import failure no longer reproduces in this environment,
  so it should not be treated as current blocker evidence.

  - Searched: local Sage category directory
    `/home/dzack/miniforge3/envs/sage/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sage/categories`;
    `sage -python` `importlib.util.find_spec(...)` for
    `sage.categories.meet_semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.join_semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.finite_meet_semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.finite_join_semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.finite_semilattices`,
    `sage.categories.posets`,
    `sage.categories.finite_posets`,
    `sage.categories.lattice_posets`, and
    `sage.categories.finite_lattice_posets`; `sage -c` imports of `Posets`,
    `FinitePosets`, `LatticePosets`, and `FiniteLatticePosets`; `sage -c`
    construction of `MeetSemilattice(...)` and `JoinSemilattice(...)`; and
    `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file posets/smoketest.sage`.
  - Found: the local category directory still contains only `posets.py`,
    `finite_posets.py`, `lattice_posets.py`, and `finite_lattice_posets.py` among
    relevant poset/lattice category modules. `find_spec(...)` returns `None` for all
    searched semilattice category module names and module specs for the four
    poset/lattice category modules. `sage -c` imports of those four categories
    succeed. Concrete Sage `MeetSemilattice(...)` and `JoinSemilattice(...)` objects
    still report category `Category of facade finite enumerated posets`. The poset
    smoke passes.
  - Conclusion: Inference: the current installed Sage environment still has concrete
    finite meet- and join-semilattice constructors but no dedicated Sage semilattice
    category modules or runtime semilattice category refinement. The project
    semilattice categories remain repo-owned category surfaces grounded in
    order-theoretic definitions and Sage concrete finite-semilattice behavior; the
    historical `sage -python` import issue is not a current path blocker.
  - Confidence: High for the installed Sage environment and current poset smoke.
  - Gaps: Remote Sage documentation and unreleased Sage source were not audited because
    this card is scoped to local import-level category evidence.

## Review Log

### Review 2026-05-07 (Codex)

**Gates passed:** Gate 1 Definition Grounding, Gate 2 Acceptance Criteria, Gate 3
Spec-Weakening, Gate 4 Gradient, Gate 5 Mathematical Correctness, Gate 6 Style and
Compliance
**Gates failed:** None
**Outcome:** reviewed; leave `status: needs-review` for human acceptance rather than
agent-side closure.

- Gate 1: The card grounds semilattice routing in Sage's local category modules,
  concrete `MeetSemilattice(...)` / `JoinSemilattice(...)` behavior, and the project
  poset mapping/spec surfaces. It does not infer a Sage semilattice category that the
  local module and runtime evidence do not expose.
- Gate 2: All acceptance criteria are satisfied. The source searches are explicit, the
  negative findings use the five-field format, design consequences remain linked to
  existing constructor/certificate and semilattice surfaces, and the required poset
  smoke was rerun after the earlier constructor/method changes.
- Gate 3: No spec or smoke obligation was deleted, narrowed, or moved. The refreshed
  evidence preserves project-owned semilattice categories rather than weakening them to
  match Sage's current category refinement.
- Gate 4: The current replay corrects one stale process fact: `sage -python` no longer
  reproduces the historical import failure here. That correction strengthens rather
  than reverses the card's conclusion because dedicated semilattice category modules
  remain absent and the poset smoke passes.
- Gate 5: The mathematical ownership claim is scoped correctly: meet- and
  join-semilattices are order-theoretic refinements of posets, while the Sage evidence
  only supplies concrete finite semilattice constructors and finite-poset/facade
  category behavior.
- Gate 6: The card keeps evidence and inference separate, avoids smoke-driven spec
  weakening, and treats the local Sage import history as path-local evidence rather
  than a global blocker.
