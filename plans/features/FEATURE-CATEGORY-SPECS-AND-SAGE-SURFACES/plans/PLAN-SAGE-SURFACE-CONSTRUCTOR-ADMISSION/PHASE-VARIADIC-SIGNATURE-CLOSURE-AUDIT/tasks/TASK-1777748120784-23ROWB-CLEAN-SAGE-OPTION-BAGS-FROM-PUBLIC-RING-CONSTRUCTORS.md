# Clean Sage option bags from public ring constructors
Source: pasted backlog 2026-05-02.

Task: clean Sage option bags from public ring constructors (MatrixSpace, VectorSpace, etc.), use explicit keyword arguments.

## Complexity Justification
- Owner: C56
- Complexity band: Moderate (41-60)
- Tracker type: task-work
- Title: Clean Sage option bags from public ring constructors
- Why this specific score:
  - This is a constrained API migration touching public ring constructors (`MatrixSpace`, `VectorSpace`, etc.). The work is moderately complex because it replaces loosely typed option-bag passing with explicit keywords while preserving constructor behavior.
- Item-specific evidence:
  - The explicit constructor list gives a bounded set of callsites, with no new domain boundaries beyond public interface normalization.
  - The owner reflects moderate risk: more than typing-only edits, but less than cross-subsystem redesign.

## Implementation Result

- Current `Rings().Constructors().MatrixRing(base_ring, n, sparse=False, implementation=None)`
  already exposes explicit parameters and delegates internally to Sage
  `MatrixSpace(base_ring, n, n, sparse=sparse, implementation=implementation)`.
- Current square-matrix element construction is split in
  `category_specs/rings/matrix_algebras.py` into
  `zero_matrix()`, `matrix_from_matrix(matrix, *, coerce=True)`,
  `matrix_from_entries(entries, *, coerce=True)`,
  `matrix_from_rows(rows, *, coerce=True)`, and
  `scalar_matrix(scalar, *, coerce=True)`.
- Current `VectorSpace` construction is not ring-owned. It is explicitly mapped and
  implemented under `Modules(K).Constructors()` as `VectorSpace(dimension, sparse=False,
  *, inner_product_matrix=None)` plus named basis/inner-product variants.
- Updated `[[SPEC-MAPPING-RINGS]]` so the `MatrixSpace.matrix` split records the
  concrete public method signatures and states that Sage's option bag is not public.

## Audit Evidence

- Searched: this task card, `category_specs/rings/__init__.py`,
  `category_specs/rings/matrix_algebras.py`, `category_specs/rings/docs/MAPPING.md`,
  `category_specs/rings/tests/regression/matrix_rings.sage`,
  `category_specs/rings/smoketest.sage`, `category_specs/modules/__init__.py`,
  `category_specs/modules/docs/MAPPING.md`, and textual searches for `MatrixRing`,
  `MatrixSpace`, `VectorSpace`, `zero_matrix`, `matrix_from`, `scalar_matrix`, `*args`,
  `**kwargs`, `kwds`, `opts`, and `options` under the rings/modules/algebras category
  surfaces.
- Found: no current public ring constructor body exposes `*args`, `**kwargs`, `kwds`,
  or a generic option bag. Remaining `kwds` / option-bag text in adjacent docs belongs
  to Sage source inventory or non-ring cards, not to the public ring constructor
  surface covered here.
- Conclusion: inference - the current implementation surface already satisfies this
  card; the durable correction is the updated ring mapping plus this owner-split audit.
- Confidence: High.
- Gaps: this pass did not close separate algebra option-bag or module wrapper cards.

## Review Log

### Review 2026-05-06 (Bohr)

**Gates passed:** Gate 1 Definition Grounding, Gate 2 Acceptance Criteria, Gate 3 Spec-Weakening, Gate 4 Gradient, Gate 6 Style and Compliance
**Gates failed:** Gate 5 Mathematical Correctness
**Outcome:** revision-required, then reworked within this card's scope

#### Gate 5 Finding: Whole Ring Smoke Was Not Passing Evidence

- `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file rings/smoketest.sage` exits 1 on
  residual ring-frontier failures including `hilbert_polynomial`, `completion`,
  `_change_print_mode`, and deferred `ZqWithPrecisionCaps` / `QqWithPrecisionCaps`.
- Those failures are not option-bag constructor regressions, but the previous card
  evidence did not explicitly route them or provide scoped passing verification.

#### Routing And Rework

- Residual `hilbert_polynomial`, `algebraic_closure`, `completion`,
  `_change_print_mode`, and q-adic precision-cap smoke frontiers are already recorded
  as downstream ring-frontier evidence in
  `[[TASK-01KQN9J3WY0J7VF8KEY1X7496H-FIX-RINGS-CATEGORY-BASE-CLASS-IDENTITY-MISMATCH-IN-NESTED-AXIOM-REFINEME]]`.
- Deferred `ZqWithPrecisionCaps(...)` and `QqWithPrecisionCaps(...)` are explicitly
  routed through
  `[[TASK-01KQN9YGCJ26WJ2044DVNVNE87-IMPLEMENT-Q-ADIC-LATTICE-PRECISION-CAP-CONSTRUCTORS-AS-EXPLICIT-BLOCKED]]`
  and
  `[[TASK-01KQN9YGCQA3E2Y2RAMA2EHZPR-RESEARCH-UPSTREAM-SAGE-SUPPORT-OR-ISSUES-FOR-Q-ADIC-UNRAMIFIED-EXTENSION]]`.
- The cited ring regression files had stale `plans.category_specs.rings` imports; these
  were mechanically repaired to `category_specs.rings` so future verification reaches
  the actual ring-frontier failures instead of a retired package path.
- Scoped verification for this card's owned surface passed through the repo justfile:
  a temporary Sage smoke checked `Rings().Constructors().MatrixRing(ZZ, 2)`, the
  matrix-algebra category membership, and `matrix_from_matrix`,
  `matrix_from_entries`, `matrix_from_rows`, and `scalar_matrix`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Matrix-ring constructor surface is explicit.
- [x] Matrix element constructor split is explicit and documented.
- [x] VectorSpace ownership is recorded as module-owned, not ring-owned.
- [x] Current public ring constructors have no generic Sage option bag in code.
- [ ] Human review accepts the audit and closes the card.
