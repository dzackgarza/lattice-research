# Remove Sage option bags from number-field and rational-field constructors
Source: pasted backlog 2026-05-02.

Task: excise Sage option bags from number-field and rational-field constructors, use explicit keyword arguments on the new public surface.

## Complexity Justification
- Owner: C55
- Complexity band: Moderate (41-60)
- Tracker type: task-work
- Title: Remove Sage option bags from number-field and rational-field constructors
- Why this specific score:
  - This is a public constructor cleanup across number/rational field entry points, with compatibility risk at constructor callsites but a bounded module surface. The work is mostly API hygiene plus argument-shape migration, which is moderately coupled and verification-heavy enough to stay in 41-60.
- Item-specific evidence:
  - The file explicitly targets constructor semantics rather than runtime algorithms, so complexity is driven by argument migration and downstream ripple through calling code.
  - No new test or acceptance list is embedded, which means the task’s own evidence focuses on implementation breadth more than checklist-driven branching.

## Implementation Result

- Current `Rings().Constructors().NumberField` already exposes explicit named
  parameters for Sage's admitted single-polynomial route and does not accept `*args`,
  `**kwargs`, `kwds`, or a generic option bag.
- Current `Rings().Constructors().NumberFieldTower(...)` already separates the
  sequence-polynomial tower case and exposes explicit sequence metadata parameters.
- Current rational-field construction is the fixed-object
  `Rings().Constructors().QQ()` route; there is no public project `RationalField(...)`
  option surface to clean.
- Updated `[[SPEC-MAPPING-RINGS]]` so the constructor table records the explicit
  number-field signatures and the rational-field fixed-object route instead of
  documenting Sage ellipses.

## Audit Evidence

- Searched: this task card, `category_specs/rings/__init__.py`,
  `category_specs/rings/docs/MAPPING.md`, `category_specs/rings/docs/SAGE_INVENTORY.md`,
  `category_specs/rings/tests/regression/number_fields.sage`,
  `category_specs/rings/tests/regression/rational_field.sage`, and textual searches for
  `def NumberField`, `def NumberFieldTower`, `def QQ`, `RationalField`, `*args`,
  `**kwargs`, `kwds`, `opts`, and `options` under `category_specs/rings`.
- Found: no public number-field or rational-field constructor in current ring code
  exposes a generic Sage option bag. The only stale option-bag language was the
  ellipsis in the mapping table for the number-field routes.
- Conclusion: inference - the implementation surface already satisfies this card, and
  the durable fix was to make the mapping document match the current explicit API.
- Confidence: High.
- Gaps: this pass did not re-audit unrelated p-adic, matrix, polynomial, or series
  constructor cards.

## Verification

- `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file
  rings/tests/new_spec/number_field_option_bag_split.sage` passes. This focused smoke
  parses `category_specs/rings/__init__.py`, proves `QQ`, `NumberField`, and
  `NumberFieldTower` have closed signatures with no `*args` or `**kwargs`, and checks
  that `[[SPEC-MAPPING-RINGS]]` records the rational-field fixed-object route plus the
  single-polynomial and tower number-field routes.
- `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file
  rings/tests/regression/number_fields.sage` currently fails at the existing
  `hilbert_polynomial` ring-frontier gap before it can provide option-bag evidence.
  That broader runtime frontier is not part of this constructor option-bag leaf.

### Re-review 2026-05-06 (Volta)

**Gates passed:** Gates 1-6
**Gates failed:** none
**Outcome:** independent re-review passed Gates 1-6; human approval still required before completion

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Number-field constructor mapping records explicit public parameters.
- [x] Number-field tower construction remains a separate named route.
- [x] Rational-field construction is recorded as fixed-object `QQ()`, not an option-bag
  constructor.
- [x] Current ring code has no `*args`, `**kwargs`, `kwds`, or generic options surface
  on the number-field/rational-field constructors.
- [ ] Human review accepts the audit and closes the card.
