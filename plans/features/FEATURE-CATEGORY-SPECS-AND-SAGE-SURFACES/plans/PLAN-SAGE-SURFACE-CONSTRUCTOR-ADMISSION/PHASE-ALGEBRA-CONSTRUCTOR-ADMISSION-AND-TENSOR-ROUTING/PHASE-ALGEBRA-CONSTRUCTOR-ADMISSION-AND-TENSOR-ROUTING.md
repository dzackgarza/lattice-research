description: The deleted Algebras triage recorded an initialization blocker for Algebras(ZZ),
  a module hom-category/forms blocker for DualObjects, and constructor admission gaps.
successCriteria:
- The sprint has a bounded set of child tracker items and an explicit scope statement.
- Completion requires each child item to be done or explicitly superseded by a linked
  successor; blocked child cards do not satisfy phase acceptance.
- The sprint closing note records smoke/test commands run and any unresolved blockers.
- Run just smoke-file algebras/smoketest.sage after algebra category initialization
  or constructor changes.
- Do not route plain-set S.algebra(R) into Algebras(R); it belongs to free_module
  over Modules(R).

# Sprint algebra constructor admission and tensor multiplication routing

## Sprint Grounding Requirements

This sprint coordinates approved leaves; it is not mathematical definition authority.
Before a sprint item changes a spec, constructor, mapping, type, or implementation
surface, its card must cite the canonical source path, exact definition, owner category,
hypotheses, codomain/return object, and proof or Sage-evidence obligations.

If a sprint finding lacks that grounding, the sprint action is source mining, decision
capture, or splitting into a prerequisite card. QC and smoke findings identify work, but
they do not define the mathematical surface being repaired.

## Summary

The deleted Algebras triage recorded an initialization blocker for Algebras(ZZ), a
module hom-category/forms blocker for DualObjects, and constructor admission gaps.

## Source Provenance

- `category_specs/algebras/docs/TRIAGE.md` was removed in commit `8d1c21c`; recover exact prior content with `git show 8d1c21c^:category_specs/algebras/docs/TRIAGE.md`.
- `category_specs/tensor_algebra_components/docs/MAPPING.md`
- Original migrated line: `Sprint algebra constructor admission and tensor multiplication routing from category_specs/algebras/docs/TRIAGE.md and category_specs/tensor_algebra_components/docs/MAPPING.md`

## Context

- Algebras(ZZ) raises _SageObject__custom_name while Sage resolves subcategory_class during category initialization.
- Algebras(ZZ).DualObjects() fails while Sage/project axiom inference builds modules.homsets._Forms; this is not an algebra constructor issue.
- Free-construction names may appear as abstract spec targets, but callable implementations require Sage-backed routing and refinement.
- Algebra construction is canonicalized to from_multiplication_tensor(multiplication=mu), where mu is a Tensor in T_R(M)[1,2].
- Basis-returning helpers such as center_basis, radical_basis, and derivations_basis should become object-returning methods such as center, radical, and derivations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The sprint has a bounded set of child tracker items and an explicit scope statement.
- [ ] Completion requires each child item to be done or explicitly superseded by a
      linked successor; blocked child cards do not satisfy phase acceptance.
- [ ] The sprint closing note records smoke/test commands run and any unresolved blockers.
- [ ] Run just smoke-file algebras/smoketest.sage after algebra category initialization or constructor changes.
- [ ] Do not route plain-set S.algebra(R) into Algebras(R); it belongs to free_module over Modules(R).

## Dependencies And Boundaries

- Keep `SAGE_INVENTORY.md` and `MAPPING.md` as the source and mapping provenance; do not recreate subtree-local `TRIAGE.md` files.
- If execution reveals a missing mathematical owner, constructor, or category graph edge, split that as a new tracker item instead of patching around it.
- Preserve the original source path in updates so future agents can trace why this item exists.

## Work Log

- Created by migration repair from inline tracker item to full-document Nimbalyst task.
