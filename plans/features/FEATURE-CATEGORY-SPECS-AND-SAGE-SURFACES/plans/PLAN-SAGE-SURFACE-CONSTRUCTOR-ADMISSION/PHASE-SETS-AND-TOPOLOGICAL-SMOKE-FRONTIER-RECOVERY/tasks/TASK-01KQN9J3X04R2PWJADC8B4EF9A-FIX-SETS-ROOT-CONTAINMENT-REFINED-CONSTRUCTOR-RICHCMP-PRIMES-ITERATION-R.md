# Fix Sets root containment refined-constructor __richcmp__ Primes iteration RealSet element-constructor and topological axiom warning
## Summary

The deleted Sets triage recorded the mapped enumeration smoke surface and current
failures for containment, rich comparison, Primes iteration, RealSet element
construction, and topological axiom resolution.

## Source Provenance

- `plans/category_specs/sets/docs/TRIAGE.md` was removed in commit `8d1c21c`; recover exact prior content with `git show 8d1c21c^:plans/category_specs/sets/docs/TRIAGE.md`.
- Original migrated line: `Fix Sets root containment refined-constructor __richcmp__ Primes iteration RealSet element-constructor and topological axiom warning from category_specs/sets/docs/TRIAGE.md`

## Context

- sets/smoketest.sage uses indexed access, rank, iteration, cardinality, and Python conversion protocols rather than Sage first/next/unrank/list/tuple helpers.
- ZZ in Sets() currently fails at the root containment statement.
- Most refined set constructors expose missing __richcmp__; Primes() exposes missing __iter__.
- RealSet interval input exposes missing _element_constructor_.
- SetPartitions(s) maps to Sets().Partitioned(), while SetPartitions() remains countable-only because it lacks a fixed powerset ambient.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The implementation changes only the scoped category-spec surface and does not weaken smokes or mapping decisions to make failures disappear.
- [x] Relevant smoke output is updated in this task body or a linked tracker item, with exact failing surfaces preserved when work remains.
- [x] The change uses project category vocabulary rather than Sage fallback helper names or wrapper-only categories.
- [x] Run just smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage after set constructor or comparison changes.
- [x] Preserve the mapped enumeration vocabulary and do not reintroduce Sage fallback helper names.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

- Keep `SAGE_INVENTORY.md` and `MAPPING.md` as the source and mapping provenance; do not recreate subtree-local `TRIAGE.md` files.
- If execution reveals a missing mathematical owner, constructor, or category graph edge, split that as a new tracker item instead of patching around it.
- Preserve the original source path in updates so future agents can trace why this item exists.
- Resolved by
  `plans/features/FEATURE-CATEGORY-SPECS-AND-SAGE-SURFACES/decisions/DECISION-20260505-REALSET-SAGE-TOPOLOGICAL-AXIOM-WARNING.md` for the
  residual Sage `Sets.Topological` warning emitted from the original Sage `RealSet`
  category join. Functional smoke rows pass; the decision accepts and documents the
  warning as inherited Sage category-provenance behavior for the current spec phase.

## Work Log

- Created by migration repair from inline tracker item to full-document Nimbalyst task.
- 2026-05-05: Fixed the root `Sets()` containment path so existing Sage set parents
  such as `ZZ` are recognized through their Sage set category. Implemented the
  project root set comparison surface with set-theoretic subset/proper-subset
  semantics, plus concrete root defaults for SymPy export, construction metadata,
  cartesian products, unions, subsets, and subset lattices. Added infinite-set
  cardinality/is-empty defaults so infinite set refinements no longer shadow Sage with
  abstract placeholders.
- Verification:
  - `python -m py_compile category_specs/sets/__init__.py category_specs/sets/subcategories/infinite.py` passed.
  - `command ruff check category_specs/sets/__init__.py category_specs/sets/subcategories/infinite.py` passed after removing an unused import and fixing import spacing.
  - `just smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` no longer reports `ZZ in Sets()` or blanket
    `__richcmp__` failures. The current frontier is `facade_for` on facade-backed set
    constructors, `cardinality` on several countable/subobject constructors, Primes
    `__iter__`, the intentionally removed `Constructors().RealSet` legacy route,
    RealSet `_element_constructor_`, and partition `_sympy_`.
  - `just smoke-file rings/smoketest.sage` also advanced past the previous root
    `__richcmp__` failures; the current rings frontier is now ring-specific
    implementation gaps such as `hilbert_polynomial`, topological `boundary`,
    `ideal_monoid`, `_change_print_mode`, q-adic deferred constructors, and matrix
    algebra/module MRO refinement.
- 2026-05-05: Removed another layer of local abstract shadowing by delegating
  facade-set defaults to Sage's `FacadeSets`, countable/enumerated defaults to Sage's
  enumerated-set providers, finite random/cardinality defaults to Sage finite
  enumerated sets, and integer-range membership/cardinality/enumeration to
  source-backed Sage semantics. `just --justfile category_specs/justfile
  smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` now reaches a narrower frontier: legacy
  `Constructors().RealSet`, RealSet interval `_element_constructor_`, recursive and
  disjoint-union `_element_constructor_`, Cartesian product `_sympy_`, subobject
  `cardinality`, image `complement`, totally ordered finite set `max`,
  finite-map/all-partition `is_parent_of`, family `_element_constructor_`,
  iterator-backed cardinality, and partition `_sympy_`.
- 2026-05-05: Cleared the remaining functional Sets smoke frontier without adding the
  rejected catch-all `Constructors().RealSet` route. The smoke now uses the admitted
  `RealSetFromIntervals` constructor, RealSet parents have concrete compactness and
  closed-bounded compact category refinement, recursive and iterator-backed set
  behavior is concrete enough for the smoke, Cartesian products and subobjects expose
  the required finite/cardinality/SymPy surfaces, image subobjects recover finite
  membership/cardinality, totally ordered finite sets expose `min`/`max`, finite-map
  and family rows pass, and partition rows pass.
- 2026-05-05: Added `PHASE-DUCK-TYPE-OBJECT-SHAPE-PROBE-AUDIT` and
  `plans/features/FEATURE-CATEGORY-SPECS-AND-SAGE-SURFACES/plans/PLAN-SMOKE-AUDIT-UNIFORMITY-STABILIZATION/PHASE-DUCK-TYPE-OBJECT-SHAPE-PROBE-AUDIT/tasks/TASK-20260505-AUDIT-CATEGORY-SPEC-DUCK-TYPE-OBJECT-SHAPE-PROBES.md`
  so `getattr`/`hasattr` object-shape probing is handled in the audit phase rather
  than folded into this smoke card.
- 2026-05-05: Validation: `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file
  sets/smoketest.sage` passes, still emitting Sage's inherited `Sets.Topological`
  warning from the original Sage `RealSet` category join; `just --justfile
  category_specs/justfile smoke-file topological_spaces/smoketest.sage` passes without
  the warning after local topological construction categories stopped invoking Sage's
  axiom reapplication path; `just --justfile category_specs/justfile
  check-abstract-redefinitions` passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- 2026-05-05: Marked this card `blocked` only on the residual Sage topological-axiom
  warning decision. The functional Sets smoke frontier is cleared, and narrower
  RealSet/ImageSubobject implementation cards were moved to `in-review` in commit
  `f606652`.
- 2026-05-05: Moved this card to `in-review` after
  `plans/features/FEATURE-CATEGORY-SPECS-AND-SAGE-SURFACES/decisions/DECISION-20260505-REALSET-SAGE-TOPOLOGICAL-AXIOM-WARNING.md` decided
  to accept and document the residual Sage warning for this phase. Validation rerun:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passes and
  still emits the documented Sage warning from
  `/home/dzack/miniforge3/envs/sage/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sage/categories/category.py:2074`.
