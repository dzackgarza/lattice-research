# Audit super_categories() returns in rings

Grep `category_specs/rings/` for `super_categories(`, extract each returned list,
and cross-reference against the admitted-edges table in PLAN-STATIC-CATEGORY-REFINEMENT-ORDER.

65 files (62 in subcategories/, 1 in __init__.py). Mechanical grep — no need to
read every file body, just the super_categories() return lines.

Write a `## Rings super_categories() inventory` section into the plan with a table:
file path, line, returned supercategories, classification (in-table/missing/exempt).
