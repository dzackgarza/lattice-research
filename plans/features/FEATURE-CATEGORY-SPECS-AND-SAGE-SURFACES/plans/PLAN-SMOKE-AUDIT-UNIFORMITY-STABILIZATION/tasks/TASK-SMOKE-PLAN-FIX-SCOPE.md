# Narrow plan description to match actual phase inventory

The plan's description promises seven areas of compliance work but only one
(duck-type object-shape probe audit) has an active phase. The variadic audit lives
under a sibling plan. Import hygiene, wrapper, type, and anti-slop are not tracked
as phases here.

Edit the plan body: narrow the description to "smoke-audit and object-shape probe
governance." Note where the other areas are handled (ruff/isort for imports,
PLAN-CATEGORY-FOUNDATION-KERNEL for wrapper/type work, style compliance gates for
anti-slop). Update the Objective sentence accordingly.
