# Fix phase inventory mismatch

The plan body's Subplans section lists `PHASE-VARIADIC-SIGNATURE-CLOSURE-AUDIT`
as a subplan, but that phase lives under `PLAN-SAGE-SURFACE-CONSTRUCTOR-ADMISSION`,
a sibling plan. The frontmatter `phases` array correctly lists only
PHASE-DUCK-TYPE-OBJECT-SHAPE-PROBE-AUDIT.

Edit the body: remove the variadic phase from Subplans. Add a note that variadic
signature work is tracked under the sibling plan. The Subplans section should
list only what this plan directly owns.
