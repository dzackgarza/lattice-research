# Remove dead source links and replace vague references

The 6-gate review G1 found two dead paths and two vague references in the plan's
Source corpus section. Edit the plan body to fix all four.

Dead paths to remove:
- `plans/LATTICE_STYLE_GUIDE.md` (does not exist on disk)
- `plans/lattice_redesign_corrections_spec.md` (does not exist on disk)

Vague references to replace:
- "Existing smoke and variadic sprint plans under `plans/features/`" →
  concrete path to the variadic phase under PLAN-SAGE-SURFACE-CONSTRUCTOR-ADMISSION
- "Existing implementation cards under `plans/features/`" →
  reference to PLAN-CATEGORY-FOUNDATION-KERNEL
