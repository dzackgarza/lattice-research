# Research Ore algebra interface integration

## Summary

Research whether `ore_algebra` should be integrated and how its differential/operator surfaces relate to planned category-spec work.

## Source Provenance

Migrated from `specs/TODO.md`: "Wrap and interface with https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra".

## Context

This is source and API research for possible exact operator computations, likely related to Picard-Fuchs operators and families of varieties.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Read upstream `ore_algebra` documentation/source enough to identify supported operator objects and Sage integration points.
- Determine which project mathematical nouns would own any exposed operations.
- Identify whether integration is needed for Picard-Fuchs or monodromy work.
- Create concrete follow-up cards for decisions, specs, or implementation if warranted.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

Do not vendor or wrap `ore_algebra` in this card. Do not invent project operator categories without a decision or approved spec plan.

## Work Log

- 2026-05-03: Created as a research card during `specs/TODO.md` migration and category-integration carding.
- 2026-05-06: Completed upstream source-admission pass. Read upstream README,
  generated docs entry points, `src/ore_algebra/ore_algebra.py`, and
  `src/ore_algebra/analytic/monodromy.py` from a temporary clone at
  `/tmp/tmp.EtH8Hu3zIu/ore_algebra`; checked local `sage -python` import; and read
  local memory `theory-graph-monodromy-hodge-methods`. Created
  `[[SPEC-ORE-ALGEBRA-BACKEND-MAPPING]]` with capability mapping, Picard-Fuchs
  boundary, and local import negative finding. Status moved to `needs-review`;
  this does not mark the card accepted or complete.

## Research Findings

- `ore_algebra` is relevant to operator-level work: Ore algebras, Ore polynomials,
  D-finite functions, closure properties, creative telescoping, desingularization,
  guessing, analytic continuation, and monodromy matrices for differential operators.
- Candidate project owners are future differential-operator, D-finite function,
  local-system, and Picard-Fuchs/period category surfaces. They are not yet defined
  in the geometry category interface.
- For Picard-Fuchs workflows, `ore_algebra` is useful after a differential operator is
  known. It does not by itself derive the correct Picard-Fuchs operator from an
  arbitrary family of curves or surfaces.
- Local import currently fails with `ImportError: cannot import name Category`, so
  any future implementation would need a separate compatibility/environment task
  before depending on the package.
