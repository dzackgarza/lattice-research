# Memory Migration Classification Ledger

Classification of every in-scope memory file for migration into the iwe2 vault
`github.com__dzackgarza__lattice-research`. Built by subagent fan-out over the
manifest. Disposition ∈ {DURABLE, JUNK, DUPLICATE}. Type ∈ {decision, trap, advice,
context, reference}. Scope default = project.

**Status:** Group A (.agents root) and Group C (.agents theory) classified. Group B
(.agents skills) and Group D (.serena dedup) re-running after session-limit reset.

## Group A — `.agents/memories/` root discipline/policy/handoff

Note: the 15 dutsik files collapse to one consolidated `reference` memory plus the
preserved `indefinite_methods` synthesis. The per-file `index.md`/`README.md` stems
collide; consolidation avoids the slug-collision problem entirely.

## Group B — `.agents/memories/skills/**`

All DURABLE except `request-triager.md`. Titles path-qualified to avoid slug collisions
on generic body stems (workflow, subtrees, code-style, …). 11 pointer+body pairs MERGE
into one memory each (pointer `skills/NAME.md` + body `skills/NAME/*.md`).

## Group D — `.serena/memories/**` dedup

46 files are pure DUPLICATE (condensed subsets of the `.agents` canonical) → DROP, no
fold-in needed. Only 6 UNIQUE files migrate.

## Summary & totals

- **DURABLE → migrate:** ~88 memories (Group A 57, Group C 28+1, Group B 45, Group D 6),
  reduced to ~77 distinct iwe2 memories after the 11 skill pointer+body merges.
- **JUNK → distill-then-trash (Phase 2):**
  - `current-goal-handoff.md` — *flagged for user decision* (live cold-start handoff, see below).
  - `provider-satisfaction-*` (5 files) — superseded goal state-machine; durable model already in repo-model-corrections.
  - `hermes/MEMORY.md`, `hermes/USER.md` — foreign Hermes/Obsidian vault state (*flagged*).
  - `index.md` — nav index, regenerable by iwe2.
  - `skills/request-triager.md` — off-domain PM boilerplate.
  - `theory/external/dutsik_polyhedral/**` (15 files) — vendored upstream docs → fold into ONE consolidated `polyhedral-common` reference; keep `notes/indefinite_methods.md`.
- **DUPLICATE → drop:** 46 `.serena` condensed copies.

### Judgment calls requiring user sign-off
1. **`current-goal-handoff.md`**: classified JUNK by the agent (status snapshot), BUT it is
   the load-bearing cold-start handoff referenced by AGENTS.md step 2 and GOAL.md:230.
   Recommend **migrate as `context`** (keep it as the mutable current-state pointer),
   NOT trash.
2. **`hermes/MEMORY.md` + `hermes/USER.md`**: Obsidian-vault / user-preference state with
   no lattice-research content. Recommend trash from this repo (content belongs in the
   user's global profile / vault-steward guidance, not project memory).
3. **Promotion candidates** (creating-fixtures, opencode-one-shot-workers, research-*
   workflow skills, memory-management-discipline, etc.): kept `scope=project` by default;
   not auto-promoted to global.
