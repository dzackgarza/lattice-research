    Canonical chain: ``Lattices(R).DualObjects()``.

    This construction is reserved for category-theoretic dual objects: parents
    represented as ``Hom_R(N, R)`` for some object ``N`` and therefore carrying
    hom-object and evaluation behavior.  The metric-dual lattice
    ``L^\# = {v in L_K | b(v, L) subset R}`` is constructed by
    ``dual_lattice()`` or the lattice-specific metric-dual construction surface.

    Diagnostics: when the global category diagnostic flag is enabled, implementations
    should emit a category diagnostic if a compatibility path or adjacent Sage spelling
    could make this Hom-dual construction look like the metric-dual construction.
