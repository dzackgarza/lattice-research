# Plan: Mypy Plugin Implementation

## Summary

Implement the Sage mypy category override plugin in three sequential phases.
This is a standalone plugin project that lives outside Sage's source tree and
must work for any importable package implementing Sage category subtrees,
including repo-local and third-party namespaces.

## Source Provenance

- `~/ai/quality-control/planning/override-sage-categories.md`: Full design doc
  and technical addendum
- `SPEC-SAGE-MYPY-CATEGORY-OVERRIDE`: 10 acceptance criteria

## Phases

### Phase 1: Sage-Side Introspection API

Build the introspection module that maps source-level method containers to Sage
runtime category classes and their dynamic base edges. Lives locally as an
importable module, not inside Sage's source tree.

### Phase 2: Mypy-Side Plugin Harness

Build the mypy plugin class that hooks `get_customize_class_mro_hook` to inject
Sage semantic bases, `get_additional_deps` for incremental mode dependency
tracking, and diagnostics for failure modes. Registered via global mypy config.

### Phase 3: Test and Verification

Build the test matrix from the spec: artificial categories for valid/invalid
overrides, diamond hierarchies, element/morphism/homset/axiom method containers,
parameterized category behavior, signature mismatches, and ancestor change
reactivity. Verify the debug oracle produces correct output.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

All three phases are sequential. Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (the mypy plugin
calls the introspection API). Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 (tests exercise the
plugin).

This plugin lives in local tooling, not in Sage's source tree. It imports Sage
as a dependency and calls Sage's existing category introspection methods
(`an_instance()`, `parent_class`, `element_class`, `morphism_class`,
`all_super_categories()`). No Sage source files are modified. The admission rule
must be semantic, not path-based: a third-party subtree is valid if it resolves
to Sage category semantics.

## Work Log

- Created 2026-05-10 from greenfield design spec and technical addendum.
- Corrected 2026-05-10: removed upstream contribution framing. This is a local
  QC plugin, not an upstream Sage contribution.
- Reopened 2026-05-10 after confirming that the current implementation is
  overfit to `sage.categories.*` fixture namespaces and that the repo QC config
  path does not load the plugin. Added rewrite work for namespace-agnostic
  admission and config-covered validation.
- Updated 2026-05-10: namespace-agnostic admission and hook matching are now
  implemented, third-party subtree fixtures/tests were added, the global QC mypy
  config now loads the plugin, and the plan is back in review-ready state.

## Current Status

Needs review. The implementation now covers Sage-side projection, mypy MRO
injection, dependency tracking, configured representative loading from
`[sage-mypy-category-plugin]`, strict diagnostics, the Sage-prefixed
verification matrix, and the clarified namespace-agnostic third-party subtree
contract. Independent review is the next step.
