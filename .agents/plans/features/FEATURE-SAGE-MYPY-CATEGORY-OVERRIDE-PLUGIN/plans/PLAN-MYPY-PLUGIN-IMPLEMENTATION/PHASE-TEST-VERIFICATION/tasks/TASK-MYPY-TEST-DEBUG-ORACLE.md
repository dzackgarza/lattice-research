# Task: Test Debug Oracle

## Summary

Verify the `debug_projection` function produces correct output for real Sage
categories, and that the output matches what the plugin actually injects.

## Context

The debug oracle is the independent verification mechanism: it prints the
projection without invoking mypy internals. This task confirms it works on
real categories and that the plugin and oracle agree.

## Source Provenance

- `~/ai/quality-control/planning/override-sage-categories.md`: "Debug Oracle"

## Acceptance Criteria

- `debug_projection("sage.categories.rings.Rings.ParentMethods")` produces valid output
- Output includes all four sections (source, dynamic class, dynamic bases, injected)
- Injected static bases match what the mypy plugin would inject
- Test works under `pytest` without mypy internals

## Current Status

Ready for review. This card's implementation is exercised by the full Sage mypy category plugin suite, verified on 2026-05-10 with `just test`: `24 passed, 3 warnings`, no skipped tests.
