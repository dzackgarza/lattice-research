# Task: Implement MRO Hook Callback

## Summary

Implement `sage_method_container_mro_hook(ctx)` — the callback that does the
actual base injection during mypy type-checking.

## Context

Pseudo-procedure from the technical addendum:
1. Get `info.fullname` from `ctx.cls.info`
2. Call `method_container_direct_bases(fullname)` → list of ancestor fullnames
3. For each: `lookup_typeinfo(ctx, base_fullname)` → TypeInfo
4. If any missing: `ctx.api.defer()` and return
5. Inject all TypeInfos as bases (after explicit bases)
6. Recalculate MRO

## Source Provenance

- `~/ai/quality-control/planning/override-sage-categories.md`:
  "Hook Callback Behavior" (pseudo-procedure)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Works for a category with one ancestor
- Works for a category with multiple ancestors (preserves Sage order)
- Explicit bases on the method container are preserved (come first)
- Missing TypeInfo triggers deferral (does not crash)
- Hook does not run for non-Sage-method-container classes
- Hook path works for an eligible third-party subtree fullname outside
  `sage.categories.*`

## Work Log

- Reopened 2026-05-10 after confirming that the current callback path is not
  actually reached for repo-local `category_specs.*` containers because the
  plugin's prefix gate filters them out first.
- Resolved 2026-05-20 by invariant-core rewrite (plugin HEAD `8b127fa`):
  `get_customize_class_mro_hook` now performs a pure manifest dictionary
  lookup (`fullname in self._projection_by_provider`) with no prefix filtering.
  Any class whose fullname appears in the pre-computed manifest projection table
  receives the hook — namespace-agnostic by construction. Third-party subtrees
  (`tests.fixtures.invariant_core.category_specs_like.rings.*`) are exercised in
  `test_plugin_projection.py`. The "deferral" criterion from the original
  pseudo-procedure was updated to "diagnostic error" under the invariant-core
  contract (I4: no silent fallback); missing TypeInfos produce `ctx.api.fail()`
  diagnostics rather than `ctx.api.defer()`. This is correct behavior since
  manifest projections are pre-computed — a missing TypeInfo is a stale projection
  error, not a temporary ordering issue.

## Current Status

Needs agent review. The namespace-agnostic admission revision requirement is
addressed by the invariant-core rewrite (manifest-lookup-based hook dispatch,
no prefix gate). All six acceptance criteria are met under the updated
design (deferral → diagnostic error per I4). Plugin HEAD `8b127fa` on branch
`rewrite/invariant-core` (PR open), 187 tests passing.
