- "For underscored items: verify the item is used at least once in its own file. An underscored item with zero local callers is suspect."
- "For public surfaces: add a smoke or test call that exercises the surface. The call proves category wiring correctness and gives vulture a cross-file usage to see."

# Resolve category-spec vulture findings through code fixes

## Summary

The original framing (expand the global vulture whitelist) was wrong. The vulture
findings are not false positives from a tool that doesn't understand our patterns.
They are genuine signals that our code has unreferenced names. The fix is in the
code, not in a bypass file.

This card is not blocked. It is a ready cleanup/audit task on the DAG: execute it
only when it is selected from the ready frontier, and do not mark it blocked unless
the selected cleanup path hits a real external prerequisite.

## Why the whitelist approach was wrong

- The repo style guide explicitly forbids `__all__` exports and requires Python's
  underscore convention for public/private distinction (`research-code-style` lines
  230--235).
- Vulture respects this convention: names starting with `_` are automatically
  ignored.
- Vulture does cross-file analysis: if `Foo` in `types.py` is imported and used in
  `rings/subcategories/fields.py`, vulture sees the usage and does not flag it.
- Therefore, every vulture finding means the name is genuinely unreferenced in our
  codebase. Adding whitelist entries hides signal that the code isn't following the
  convention we chose.

## Context

The 2026-05-03 Codex Spark triage found 762 category-spec vulture findings after
Ruff normalization passed. These include:

- Public type aliases in `category_specs/types.py` with no cross-file importers.
- Abstract methods on Sage category `ParentMethods`/`ElementMethods` classes with
  no call sites in our code.
- Package re-export variables in `category_specs/__init__.py` that nothing imports.
- Private-looking helpers that lack underscore prefixes.

The abstract methods are a special case. Sage dispatches them dynamically through
category machinery that vulture cannot trace. But if e.g. `Sets().cardinality()`
is an abstract method we specify, and no smoke test calls `cardinality()` on a set
object, vulture correctly reports it as unused. The fix is to call it in a smoke,
which also validates that the category graph routes correctly.

## Resolution Strategy

For each of the 762 findings, classify into exactly one bucket:

### Bucket 1: Underscore-prefix (internal)

For items that are genuinely internal helpers, prefix with `_`. Vulture ignores
`_`-prefixed names. This is the style guide's mechanism and vulture's escape hatch.

**Subtlety:** an underscored item with zero callers even within its own defining
file is still suspect. If an internal helper exists only to exist, it is dead code
and belongs in Bucket 3. Do not mechanically `_`-prefix everything -- verify each
item is actually used.

### Bucket 2: Smoke/test call (public surface)

For items that are genuinely part of our public API, add a smoke or test call that
exercises the surface. Examples:

- `types.py` exports `ModuleElement` but nothing imports it -> add a smoke that
  imports and uses it.
- `Sets().ParentMethods.cardinality` is specified but never called -> add a smoke
  that constructs a set object and calls `.cardinality()` on it.
- `__init__.py` re-exports `Rings` but no downstream module imports from the
  package -> either find the intended consumer and add the import, or determine
  that the re-export itself is dead (Bucket 3).

The call validates category wiring and gives vulture the cross-file usage chain it
needs. It is not onerous checkboxing -- it proves the category graph routes
correctly.

### Bucket 3: Delete (dead code)

Items that are not used, not intended to be public, and not justifiable as internal
helpers. Delete them.

## What has already been done

- The global QC `_python-qc-files` and `_sage-qc-files` recipes now exclude
  `**/*.bak/**` directories. Vulture no longer scans `src.bak/` or `tests.bak/`.
- The spec backup files that produced 3 of the original findings were moved to
  `src.bak/spec-backups/`. Those findings are resolved.
- The 762 remaining findings are all in `category_specs/**`.

## Boundaries

- Do not add entries to `/home/dzack/ai/quality-control/vulture_whitelist.py` without
  prior user review and approval.
- Do not add local vulture bypasses, ignore files, or QC overrides.
- Do not delete category-spec API surfaces that are intended to be public.
- Do not mechanically `_`-prefix without verifying the item is actually used.
- Do not add smoke calls that are tautological (`assert Foo is not None`).

## Final whitelist gate (user review)

After all three buckets are exhausted, some genuine edge cases may remain: Sage
dynamic dispatch patterns where the method cannot be expressed as a static call in
our code. Present these to the user with:

- The exact name and defining file
- Why it cannot be resolved through underscore prefix (it is genuinely public)
- Why it cannot be resolved through a smoke call (no statically-callable surface exists)
- The proposed whitelist entry

Do not add whitelist entries silently. Agents were previously too eager to whitelist
violations to silence QC rather than addressing the issues they unearthed.

## Validation

- After cleanup, run `just test`; if public QC reaches vulture, verify vulture passes.
  If public QC stops before vulture at an unrelated earlier stage, record the first
  blocker and use the repo-scoped global `_vulture` recipe only as bounded vulture
  evidence.
- All remaining findings must either be resolved through code fixes or presented to
  the user in the final whitelist gate.

## Progress

- 2026-05-06 first bounded slice: root package re-export findings in
  `category_specs/__init__.py` were resolved by adding real Cat smoke assertions that
  use the root package module exports for `algebras`, `cat`, `forms`, `homsets`,
  `lattices`, `modules`, `posets`, `rings`, `sets`, and `topological_spaces`.
- The same Cat smoke slice now exercises the opt-in category diagnostic utility
  surface in `category_specs/utils.py`: disabled-by-default behavior, enable/disable,
  logger access, history clearing, and once-per-key emission.
- `category_specs/cat/smoketest.sage` passes after these assertions.
- A vulture-only diagnostic through the global QC recipe confirms these names no longer
  appear in the vulture finding list. This diagnostic is inventory evidence only; final
  validation remains `just test`.
- 2026-05-06 second bounded slice: generated Sage-file findings under
  `category_specs/**` were resolved by using the exterior algebra generator `yE` in the
  module smoke, deleting a genuinely dead reversed diamond-cover predicate from the
  poset smoke, removing a stale unused number-field import, and making the finite
  iterator witness assert its empty finite-set behavior. The same pass corrected the
  iterator regression file to use the project constructor's nullary iterator-factory
  contract.
- Validation for the second slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file posets/smoketest.sage` passed;
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/tests/regression/enumerated_set_from_iterator.sage`
  passed; vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports generated Sage findings under
  `category_specs/**`.
- `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file modules/smoketest.sage` still
  fails on existing module category implementation gaps; the edited exterior-algebra
  assertions now fail only at the pre-existing Sage/category base-class mismatch rather
  than the temporary nonhomogeneous relation error. `rings/tests/regression/number_fields.sage`
  reaches the existing `hilbert_polynomial` implementation gap after the stale import
  path was corrected.
- 2026-05-06 third bounded slice: 100%-confidence unused-parameter findings were
  cleared in abstract/spec method stubs without changing public parameter names. The
  affected files were `category_specs/algebras/__init__.py`,
  `category_specs/algebras/subcategories/with_basis.py`,
  `category_specs/cat/homsets.py`,
  `category_specs/lattices/subcategories/over_integers.py`,
  `category_specs/modules/subcategories/finitely_presented_graded_modules.py`,
  `category_specs/modules/subcategories/finitely_presented_over_pid.py`,
  `category_specs/modules/subcategories/integer_lattices.py`, and
  `category_specs/modules/subcategories/with_basis.py`.
- Validation for the third slice: the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports the
  targeted unused formal parameters from those files. Remaining 100%-confidence
  category-spec findings are in other surfaces such as forms, rings, sets, and tensor
  components.
- 2026-05-06 fourth bounded slice: the remaining 100%-confidence formal-parameter
  findings under `category_specs/**` were cleared while preserving the public
  signatures. This covered the remaining forms, module, ring, set, and tensor-component
  abstract or overload stubs.
- Validation for the fourth slice: the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports any
  100%-confidence findings under `category_specs/**`. The remaining category-spec
  diagnostics are 60%-confidence public surfaces that need smoke coverage, deletion,
  or source-grounded internalization.
- 2026-05-06 fifth bounded slice: generated Sage test locals outside
  `category_specs/**` were resolved by turning the locals into substantive assertions
  or by correcting an unused bivariate polynomial-ring declaration to the univariate
  ring actually used by the hyperelliptic-curve witness.
- Validation for the fifth slice: the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  generated Sage findings under `tests/sage_spec/**` or `tests/variety_spec/**`.
  Remaining vulture output is now concentrated in `category_specs/**`
  60%-confidence public surfaces.
- 2026-05-06 sixth bounded slice: Cat smoke coverage was extended for alias routing
  (`Slice`, `Coslice`, `Endsets`), the Cat subobject construction class,
  `CatEndCategory.Autset`, endofunctor/autofunctor predicates, and axiom defining
  predicates.
- Validation for the sixth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file cat/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports the targeted Cat alias,
  subobject-class, end/aut predicate, or base-category defining-predicate findings.
  Remaining Cat diagnostics are concentrated in abstract construction-functor methods
  and slice/coslice structure-category stubs.
- 2026-05-06 seventh bounded slice: a dedicated `category_specs/types_smoketest.sage`
  was added to exercise centralized `types.py` alias packages against their intended
  category/object/element/morphism anchors, and the category-spec smoke recipe now runs
  that smoke file first.
- Validation for the seventh slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file types_smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports `category_specs/types.py` findings or
  generated findings from the new type smoke.
- 2026-05-06 eighth bounded slice: finite-poset smoke coverage was added for
  `Posets().Finite()` class routing and the finite diamond poset's top/bottom,
  extremal elements, cover relation iterator, intervals, height/width certificates,
  semilattice certificates, chains, antichains, and linear extensions.
- Validation for the eighth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file posets/smoketest.sage` passed,
  and the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  `category_specs/posets/subcategories/finite.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 ninth bounded slice: finite-lattice smoke coverage was added for the
  project-refined diamond lattice's complements, atomic/coatomic/complemented/
  distributive certificates, modular and semidistributive surfaces, sublattice
  construction, congruence generation, and congruence lattice construction.
- Validation for the ninth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file posets/smoketest.sage` passed,
  and the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  `category_specs/posets/subcategories/finite_lattice.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 tenth bounded slice: forms-chain smoke coverage was added for concrete
  formed/bilinear/symmetric/integral predicate forwarding plus abstract method ownership
  on the finite-rank formed-module axiom chain.
- Validation for the tenth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file forms/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports `category_specs/forms/chain.py`
  findings.
- 2026-05-06 eleventh bounded slice: modules-with-basis smoke coverage was added for
  with-basis and with-ordered-basis category ownership, combinatorial-free-module
  term/coefficient/monomial surfaces, basis-index and basis-order forwarding helpers,
  and explicit abstract ownership of reduction, basis-map morphism construction,
  echelonized-basis-matrix, coordinate-vector, and coordinate-module surfaces.
- Validation for the eleventh slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file modules/smoketest.sage` still
  fails on the existing module implementation-gap frontier, but the new with-basis
  assertions are not among the reported failures. The vulture-only diagnostic no longer
  reports `category_specs/modules/subcategories/with_basis.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 twelfth bounded slice: topological-space smoke coverage was added for
  root topological axiom ownership, topological/metric/connected/compact/complete
  predicate surfaces, topological and metric Hom/Aut element predicates, direct
  Sage-supercategory splice policy, and objects-over/objects-under structure-space
  surfaces.
- Validation for the twelfth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file topological_spaces/smoketest.sage`
  passed, and the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  `category_specs/topological_spaces/**` findings.
- 2026-05-06 thirteenth bounded slice: generic Hom/End smoke coverage was added for
  the owned `is_endomorphism_set` semantics: Hom objects compute the predicate from
  domain/codomain equality, while End objects report true by construction.
- Validation for the thirteenth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file homsets/smoketest.sage` passed,
  and the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  `category_specs/homsets/homsets.py` or `category_specs/homsets/endsets.py`
  predicate findings.
- 2026-05-06 fourteenth bounded slice: Cat smoke coverage was extended for the
  category-internal functor surface and Sage construction-functor combinator surface:
  `_coerce_into_domain`, `_apply_functor`, `_apply_functor_to_morphism`,
  `coercion_reversed`, `pushout`, `merge`, `commutes`, `expand`, and `common_base`.
- Validation for the fourteenth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file cat/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports `category_specs/cat/homsets.py`
  findings.
- 2026-05-06 fifteenth bounded slice: modules smoke coverage was extended for the
  base `Modules(R)` object surface's default negative predicates for specialized
  subcategories: lattice, representation-module, free-graded, finitely-presented
  graded, Ore, torsion-quadratic, and ring-object-as-module.
- Validation for the fifteenth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file modules/smoketest.sage` still
  fails on the existing module implementation-gap frontier, but the new base-predicate
  assertion is not among the reported failures. The vulture-only diagnostic no longer
  reports the targeted `category_specs/modules/__init__.py` predicate findings.
- 2026-05-06 sixteenth bounded slice: poset smoke coverage was extended for root
  reverse comparisons, lower covers, order ideals, order filters, poset Hom/End/Aut
  predicates, objects-over/objects-under structure-poset surfaces, finite meet/join
  semilattice extremal elements, operation matrices, pseudocomplements, and generated
  meet/join subsemilattices.
- Validation for the sixteenth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file posets/smoketest.sage` passed,
  and the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports `category_specs/posets/**`
  findings.
- 2026-05-06 seventeenth bounded slice: partitioned-set smoke coverage was added for
  fixed-base partition blocks as subsets of the powerset, refinement/strict-refinement
  order, ordered finite partition statistics, noncrossing/nonnesting predicates, and
  finite-totally-ordered-base ownership. The slice also fixed `blocks()` so a refined
  Sage set partition is converted through its blocks rather than passed directly to
  `SageSet`.
- Validation for the seventeenth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  `category_specs/sets/subcategories/partitioned.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 eighteenth bounded slice: graded-set smoke coverage was added for
  `Sets().Graded()` ownership, the graded-set standard type package aliases, and the
  abstract `grading_set`, `grading`, and `generating_series` surfaces.
- Validation for the eighteenth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  `category_specs/sets/subcategories/graded.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 nineteenth bounded slice: root set smoke coverage was extended for
  `free_algebra` ownership and `Sets().WithRealizations()` / `Sets().Realizations()`
  construction-category routing. A direct finite-set `free_algebra(ZZ)` smoke was not
  added because it crosses into the existing algebra refinement gap before proving the
  set root surface.
- Validation for the nineteenth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports `category_specs/sets/__init__.py`
  findings.
- 2026-05-06 twentieth bounded slice: set realization smoke coverage was added for
  `SetsWithRealizations` parent realization surfaces and `_Realizations` parent/element
  change-of-realization surfaces.
- Validation for the twentieth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  `category_specs/sets/subcategories/constructions/with_realizations.py` or
  `category_specs/sets/subcategories/constructions/realizations.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 twenty-first bounded slice: Cartesian-product smoke coverage was added
  for product factor keys, parent projection objects, product self-coercion, and
  element coordinate projection.
- Validation for the twenty-first slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  `category_specs/sets/subcategories/cartesian_product.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 twenty-second bounded slice: real-subset smoke coverage was added for
  universe detection, disjointness, pairwise disjointness, and convex hulls of finite
  real-subset families.
- Validation for the twenty-second slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports
  `category_specs/sets/subcategories/real_set.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 twenty-third bounded slice: elementary set-axis smoke coverage was added
  for finite, infinite, countable, finite-countable, infinite-countable, facade,
  totally ordered, and uncountable category routing plus their countability/order
  predicate surfaces.
- Validation for the twenty-third slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports the targeted elementary set-axis
  findings in `countable.py`, `finite.py`, `infinite.py`, `facade.py`,
  `totally_ordered.py`, or `uncountable.py`.
- 2026-05-06 twenty-fourth bounded slice: set-family, recursively-enumerated-set, and
  G-set smoke coverage was added for family keys, inverse-family ownership, recursive
  children, bounded successor digraphs, naive traversal ownership, orbit/fixed-point
  ownership, and element action ownership.
- Validation for the twenty-fourth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports `family.py`,
  `recursively_enumerated.py`, or `group_actions.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 twenty-fifth bounded slice: disjoint-union, finite-map, and set-quotient
  smoke coverage was added for disjoint-union membership recognition, Sage
  disjoint-union element-constructor hook ownership, finite-map list construction, and
  set-quotient ambient/equivalence-class ownership.
- Validation for the twenty-fifth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports `disjoint_union.py`,
  `finite_set_maps.py`, or `constructions/quotients.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 twenty-sixth bounded slice: isomorphic-object smoke coverage was added
  for the distinguished `isomorphism()` surface and `Sets().IsomorphicObjects()`
  routing.
- Validation for the twenty-sixth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file sets/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports any `category_specs/sets/**`
  findings.
- 2026-05-06 twenty-seventh bounded slice: algebra smoke coverage was added for
  algebra generator and derivation ownership, algebra subcategory routing,
  with-basis finite-dimensional refinement, semisimplicity predicates, algebra
  End-category base-algebra ownership, slice structure-algebra ownership, quotient
  projection ownership, and ideal standard type-package surfaces.
- Validation for the twenty-seventh slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file algebras/smoketest.sage` still
  fails on existing algebra implementation gaps (`alternating_algebra`,
  `algebra_generators`, and `annihilator`), but the new ownership assertions are not
  among the reported failures. The vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports any
  `category_specs/algebras/**` findings.
- 2026-05-06 twenty-eighth bounded slice: module Hom smoke coverage was added for
  scalar multiplication of module morphisms and form-refinement routing through
  `Modules(R).HomCategory().Forms()`, including bilinear, quadratic, and
  nondegenerate form subcategory surfaces.
- Validation for the twenty-eighth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file modules/smoketest.sage` still
  fails on the existing module implementation-gap frontier, but the new Hom/form
  ownership assertion is not among the reported failures. The vulture-only diagnostic
  no longer reports `category_specs/modules/homsets.py` findings.
- 2026-05-06 twenty-ninth bounded slice: module smoke coverage was extended for axiom
  subcategory routing, module slice `structure_module()` ownership, finite-presentation
  graded `presentation()` ownership, PID Smith-generator and p-elementary ownership,
  and Ore-module companion-matrix ownership.
- Validation for the twenty-ninth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file modules/smoketest.sage` still
  fails on the existing module implementation-gap frontier, but the new assertions are
  not among the reported failures. The vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports any
  `category_specs/modules/**` findings.
- 2026-05-06 thirtieth bounded slice: Cat smoke coverage was added for slice and
  coslice `structure_category()` ownership.
- Validation for the thirtieth slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file cat/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports `category_specs/cat/**` findings.
- 2026-05-06 thirty-first bounded slice: forms smoke coverage was added for
  alternating isotropy, bilinear element inner product, free-bilinear tensor product
  and self product, rational integral rescaling, and symmetric element divisibility
  ownership.
- Validation for the thirty-first slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file forms/smoketest.sage` passed, and
  the vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports `category_specs/forms/**` findings.
- 2026-05-06 thirty-second bounded slice: ring smoke coverage was added for root
  ideal-monoid, approximate, and algebra-over ownership; ring element divisibility;
  ring Hom/End Sage-refinement constructors; field and global-field category routing;
  reduced/localization/divisibility owner surfaces; real/complex precision change
  owners; p-adic precision, prime-change, and print-mode mutation owners; matrix
  zero/sparse owners; and number-field/QQ ring-of-integers-at-primes surfaces.
- Validation for the thirty-second slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file rings/smoketest.sage` still fails
  on the existing ring implementation frontier (`hilbert_polynomial`, `ideal_monoid`,
  `algebraic_closure`, `_change_print_mode`, matrix MRO, and deferred q-adic
  precision-cap constructors), but the new ring ownership assertions are not among
  the reported failures. The vulture-only diagnostic no longer reports any
  `category_specs/rings/**` findings. Remaining vulture findings are now isolated to
  `category_specs/lattices/**`.
- 2026-05-06 thirty-third bounded slice: lattice smoke coverage was added for
  lattice-specific construction routers, lazy construction-class attributes,
  even/unimodular predicates, lattice End base-lattice ownership, slice structure
  lattice ownership, subobject ambient and orthogonal-complement surfaces, metric-dual
  lattice owner surfaces, Hom-dual standard type-package aliases, overlattice and
  orthogonal-direct-sum type packages, discriminant-group type packages and primary
  decomposition surfaces, and OverPID/OverIntegers/OverDedekind owner methods.
- The same slice fixed the `category_specs.lattices.chain` compatibility surface so
  documented imports of `LatticesCategory` from that module work. It also corrected the
  smoke's previous `DualLattices() aliases DualObjects()` assertion: the lattice
  redesign docs distinguish metric-dual lattices from Hom-dual objects, so the smoke now
  records the metric-dual owner surface without conflating it with the Hom-dual
  construction.
- Validation for the thirty-third slice:
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file lattices/smoketest.sage` passed;
  `just --justfile category_specs/justfile smoke-file lattices/chain_smoketest.sage`
  passed; the vulture-only diagnostic passed and no longer reports any
  `category_specs/**` findings.
- Current public `just test` still fails before vulture at the global mypy stage with
  the existing Sage/stub/type surface. That is not a blocker for this leaf's continued
  vulture cleanup, but it means final acceptance cannot yet claim full QC success.
- 2026-05-07 revalidation found one stale category-spec vulture finding introduced by
  Ruff E741 cleanup:
  `category_specs/modules/subcategories/free.py:178: unused variable 'ell'`.
  The abstract `tensor_module(k, ell, *, sym, antisym)` stub now preserves the public
  signature and uses the established `del`-then-ellipsis convention for intentionally
  unused abstract-stub parameters.
- Current validation after that fix: `python -m compileall -q
  category_specs/modules/subcategories/free.py` passed; `uvx --from ruff ruff check
  category_specs/modules/subcategories/free.py` passed; `just -f
  /home/dzack/ai/quality-control/justfile -d /home/dzack/research _vulture` passed.
  Public `just test` still passes Python and Sage syntax validation, then stops at
  global mypy before Vulture with missing Sage/pytest stubs and broad category typing
  errors.
- Spec-weakening review: this slice added smoke coverage and did not delete abstract
  methods, narrow smokes, remove constructor obligations, or move any spec surface.
  The third slice preserved public signatures and only made existing stub bodies refer
  to their documented parameters so vulture can distinguish intentional API from dead
  locals.

- Gate 5: Each bounded slice individually traceable with date, files, smoke file, vulture diagnostic.
- Gate 6: Edge cases handled: zero-caller items flagged, Sage dynamic dispatch noted, stale `ell` caught and fixed.

Verification: `just --justfile category_specs/justfile _vulture category_specs` passes for scoped evidence.

### Independent Review - 2026-05-07

Reviewer: Banach.

Outcome: revision finding addressed; card remains `needs-agent-review` for fresh review and
human acceptance.

Gate 2 finding:

- The card's vulture-only completion claim was stale. Repo-scoped global `_vulture`
  still reported `category_specs/modules/subcategories/free.py:178: unused variable
  'ell'` before the revalidation fix.
- The original validation wording required public `just test` to verify Vulture, but
  current public `just test` stops at global mypy before Vulture. The validation
  criterion now records the first public-QC blocker and treats `_vulture` as bounded
  evidence for this leaf only, not as full-QC acceptance.

Follow-up rework:

- Preserved the `tensor_module(k, ell, *, sym, antisym)` public signature and added
  `del k, ell, sym, antisym` before the abstract ellipsis.
- Re-ran the touched-file compile/Ruff checks, repo-scoped global `_vulture`, and
  public `just test`; the first public-QC blocker remains global mypy before Vulture.
