# Sprint ring axiom identity mismatch q-adic precision frontier and matrix algebra surface split

## Sprint Grounding Requirements

This sprint coordinates approved leaves; it is not mathematical definition authority.
Before a sprint item changes a spec, constructor, mapping, type, or implementation
surface, its card must cite the canonical source path, exact definition, owner category,
hypotheses, codomain/return object, and proof or Sage-evidence obligations.

If a sprint finding lacks that grounding, the sprint action is source mining, decision
capture, or splitting into a prerequisite card. QC and smoke findings identify work, but
they do not define the mathematical surface being repaired.

## Summary

The deleted Rings triage recorded ring smoke blockers: nested axiom category identity
mismatches, missing _sympy_ methods on refined parents, and the matrix-ring surface
split.

## Source Provenance

- `category_specs/rings/docs/TRIAGE.md` was removed in commit `8d1c21c`; recover exact prior content with `git show 8d1c21c^:category_specs/rings/docs/TRIAGE.md`.
- `category_specs/rings/docs/MAPPING.md`
- Original migrated line: `Sprint ring axiom identity mismatch q-adic precision frontier and matrix algebra surface split from category_specs/rings/docs/TRIAGE.md and category_specs/rings/docs/MAPPING.md`

## Context

- ZZ, field constructors, p-adic constructors, and q-adic constructors fail through nested axiom category class-identity mismatches.
- IntegerModRing, PolynomialRing, PowerSeriesRing, LaurentSeriesRing, PuiseuxSeriesRing, and MatrixRing refine far enough to expose missing _sympy_.
- MatrixRing stays reachable from Rings().Constructors(), but the result must refine into Algebras(R) and Modules(R).Free().FiniteRank().
- The matrix smoke must not be moved or weakened to hide the surface split.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The sprint has a bounded set of child tracker items and an explicit scope statement.
- [ ] Completion requires each child item to be done or explicitly superseded by a
      linked successor; blocked child cards do not satisfy phase acceptance.
- [ ] The sprint closing note records smoke/test commands run and any unresolved blockers.
- [ ] Run just smoke-file rings/smoketest.sage after ring constructor or axiom changes.
- [ ] Confirm failures are reduced without weakening constructor membership assertions.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

- Keep `SAGE_INVENTORY.md` and `MAPPING.md` as the source and mapping provenance; do not recreate subtree-local `TRIAGE.md` files.
- If execution reveals a missing mathematical owner, constructor, or category graph edge, split that as a new tracker item instead of patching around it.
- Preserve the original source path in updates so future agents can trace why this item exists.

## Work Log

- Created by migration repair from inline tracker item to full-document Nimbalyst task.

## 6-Gate Protocol Review Log

### Review 2026-05-07 (opencode-go subagent — 6-gate phase card review)

**Gates passed:** Gate 1 Source Paths, Gate 2 Exit Criteria Checkability, Gate 3 Task Inventory Complete, Gate 4 Scope Containment, Gate 5 Dependencies Correct, Gate 6 No Weakening
**Gates failed:** none
**Outcome:** phase card passes all 6 gates; status remains `needs-agent-review` pending human acceptance and child task closure.

---

#### Gate 1 — Source Paths

The phase card records recoverable source provenance:
- `category_specs/rings/docs/TRIAGE.md` (removed in commit `8d1c21c`; recoverable via `git show 8d1c21c^:category_specs/rings/docs/TRIAGE.md`)
- `category_specs/rings/docs/MAPPING.md`
- Original migration line documenting traceability from deleted triage content.

Each child task independently carries its own source provenance section. Source paths are specific, recoverable, and traceable from both the phase card and each leaf task. **Pass.**

#### Gate 2 — Exit Criteria Checkability

The phase card lists 5 success criteria:
1. "The sprint has a bounded set of child tracker items and an explicit scope statement." — **Checkable.** Directory listing confirms 7 substantive child tasks + 1 wrapup = 8 bounded items. Scope statement exists in the description.
2. "Completion requires each child item to be done or explicitly superseded by a linked successor; blocked child cards do not satisfy phase acceptance." — **Checkable.** Child statuses can be audited: 3 tasks `complete`, 3 tasks `needs-human-input` (stale _sympy_ superseded by linked successors; q-adic implementation; modules smoke), 1 task `unstarted` (wrapup). The stale _sympy_ leaf has linked successors documented in its body. Phase acceptance is not yet satisfiable pending wrapup and human signoff.
3. "The sprint closing note records smoke/test commands run and any unresolved blockers." — **Checkable.** Requires wrapup task (TASK-WRAPUP-PHASE-RING-AXIOM-Q-ADIC-AND-MATRIX-ALGEBRA-SURFACES) to execute and record.
4. "Run just smoke-file rings/smoketest.sage after ring constructor or axiom changes." — **Checkable.** Multiple child tasks have recorded smoke runs with concrete output.
5. "Confirm failures are reduced without weakening constructor membership assertions." — **Checkable.** Child task review logs include spec-weakening checks; aggregate smoke still fails on preserved frontiers (hilbert_polynomial, algebraic_closure, completion, _change_print_mode, deferred q-adic caps) rather than weakened assertions.

All criteria are specific enough to be verified by a reviewer with access to the repo and Sage runtime. The criteria referencing smoke files name exact paths. **Pass.**

#### Gate 3 — Task Inventory Complete

Child tasks in `tasks/` directory (8 total):
| # | Task ID | Title | Status |
|---|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | TASK-01KQN9J3WY0J7VF8KEY1X7496H | Fix Rings category base-class identity mismatch | complete |
| 2 | TASK-01KQN9J3WZDBZ8D0BPGG8AKVXH | Implement missing _sympy_ surface | needs-human-input |
| 3 | TASK-01KQN9YGCJ26WJ2044DVNVNE87 | Implement q-adic lattice precision-cap constructors | needs-human-input |
| 4 | TASK-01KQN9YGCKBZM1PG5YYQW5A8M6 | Implement matrix-ring refinement | complete |
| 5 | TASK-01KQN9YGCQA3E2Y2RAMA2EHZPR | Research upstream Sage support for q-adic | complete |
| 6 | TASK-01KQN9J3WXGKSYTRTQDP54C28J | Fix Modules smoke missing algebra _sympy_ | needs-human-input |
| 7 | TASK-1777748120685-4VX3GB | Strip import and LazyImport bloat | complete |
| 8 | TASK-WRAPUP-PHASE-RING... | Phase wrap-up | unstarted |

Coverage against phase scope:
- **Nested axiom category identity mismatches** → Task 1 (base-class identity mismatch fix; complete, Gates 1-6 passed)
- **Missing _sympy_ methods on refined parents** → Task 2 (stale _sympy_ leaf; superseded by linked successors in tasks 1, 3, 4, 5; needs-human-input)
- **Matrix-ring surface split** → Task 4 (matrix-ring refinement into Algebras(R) and Modules(R).Free().FiniteRank(); complete, verified)
- **Q-adic precision frontier** → Tasks 3 + 5 (implementation of deferred constructors + upstream Sage research; both reviewed)
- **Modules smoke** → Task 6 (cross-category smoke fix; reviewed, Gates 1-6 passed, modules/smoketest.sage now passes)
- **Import hygiene** → Task 7 (import/LazyImport bloat cleanup; complete)
- **Phase closure** → Task 8 (wrapup; unstarted, depends on all siblings being done)

The inventory covers all areas named in the phase description. The one stale leaf (task 2, _sympy_) is properly documented with linked successors per the phase acceptance criteria. No gap areas are evident. **Pass.**

#### Gate 4 — Scope Containment

Phase boundaries are explicit:
- Keep `SAGE_INVENTORY.md` and `MAPPING.md` as source/mapping provenance; do not recreate `TRIAGE.md` files.
- Split newly discovered missing owners, constructors, or category graph edges as new tracker items.
- Preserve original source paths.

Child task scope audit:
- Task 1: scoped to `category_specs/rings/subcategories/` — eager imports replace LazyImport placeholders for nested ring axiom categories. No cross-category leakage.
- Task 2: no implementation changes; stale leaf documented with successor links. No scope expansion.
- Task 3: scoped to `category_specs/rings/__init__.py` (existing deferred constructors). No new surface created.
- Task 4: scoped to matrix algebra refinement; touches `category_specs/rings/` and `category_specs/algebras/`. Cross-category but within the constructor-admission plan scope.
- Task 5: pure research; no code changes. Within upstream Sage investigation scope.
- Task 6: scoped to `category_specs/modules/`; passes modules smoke. Cross-category but justified as part of broader constructor admission.
- Task 7: scoped to `category_specs/rings/subcategories/` — import hygiene only. No mathematical changes.

No child task expands beyond its stated boundaries. The modules smoke task (6) crosses into modules territory, but the phase card's parent plan (PLAN-SAGE-SURFACE-CONSTRUCTOR-ADMISSION) governs both rings and modules constructor admission, so this is within the plan's remit. **Pass.**

#### Gate 5 — Dependencies Correct

Phase card:
- `dependsOn: []` — correct; this is a phase coordinating leaf tasks, not a leaf itself.
- `parents: ['[[PLAN-SAGE-SURFACE-CONSTRUCTOR-ADMISSION]]']` — verified on disk; the plan card lists this phase in its `phases:` array.

Child task dependencies:
- Tasks 1-7: all `dependsOn: []` — correct; these are independent leaf tasks that can be worked in parallel.
- Task 8 (wrapup): `dependsOn:` lists all 7 sibling tasks — correct; the wrapup is a gatekeeper that must run after all substantive work.

No missing dependency edges detected. The wrapup correctly gates on all siblings. The phase card correctly gates on its plan parent. **Pass.**

#### Gate 6 — No Weakening

The phase card explicitly guards against weakening in multiple places:
- Description: "The matrix smoke must not be moved or weakened to hide the surface split."
- Success criteria: "Confirm failures are reduced without weakening constructor membership assertions."
- Dependencies: "If execution reveals a missing mathematical owner, constructor, or category graph edge, split that as a new tracker item instead of patching around it."

Child task weakening review:
- Task 1: Review Log documents spec-weakening check passed. Smoke still fails on preserved frontiers; only base-class identity mismatch was repaired.
- Task 2: No implementation changes made; stale leaf preserved with linked successors.
- Task 3: Implementation preserves admitted deferred names with explicit AssertionError; smoke preserves frontier labels.
- Task 4: Review Log documents spec-weakening review passed. Regression category names updated to current vocabulary without weakening membership claims. Aggregate smoke still shows preserved non-matrix frontiers.
- Task 5: No code/spec/smoke changes; research result preserves deferred names.
- Task 6: Review Log documents Gates 1-6 passed including spec-weakening check. modules/smoketest.sage now passes without restoring wrapper categories.
- Task 7: Review Log documents spec-weakening review: "does not delete abstract methods, narrow smoke assertions, move mathematical obligations, or change category ownership."

No child task weakens constructor membership assertions, narrows smoke tests, or hides failures. The aggregate rings/smoketest.sage still fails on documented, preserved frontiers — this is gap evidence, not hidden surface splits. **Pass.**

---

#### Summary

All 6 gates pass. The phase card has:
- Traceable source paths (G1)
- Checkable exit criteria (G2)
- Complete child task inventory covering all scope areas (G3)
- Contained scope with explicit boundaries (G4)
- Correct dependency edges (G5)
- Anti-weakening guards enforced in all child tasks (G6)

The phase is not yet closable because:
1. Three child tasks remain `needs-human-input` (tasks 2, 3, 6)
2. The wrapup task (task 8) is `unstarted` and blocks on sibling completion
3. Human approval is required per category-spec policy for all `needs-human-input` items

No structural defects found in the phase card itself. Recommend keeping `status: needs-agent-review` until human acceptance of remaining `needs-human-input` leaves and wrapup execution.
