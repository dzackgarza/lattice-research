description: Build and validate the declarative spec-core and construction-witness
  slice for finite/countable cartesian products realized as free finite-rank modules.
successCriteria:
- The declarative spec/report kernel exists before module-specific witness logic.
- Module witness logic consumes the spec/report kernel and records finite and countable
  cartesian-product provenance.
- Focused validation proves the `GF(5)^3` finite case and the `ZZ^2` countable case.

# Spec core vertical slice

## Summary

This phase turns the approved pivot into three executable leaves: a typed spec/report
kernel, module construction witnesses, and focused validation. It is deliberately not a
new broad category-expansion phase.

## Source Provenance

- `[[PLAN-SPEC-CORE-VERTICAL-SLICE]]`
- `/home/dzack/vault/projects/research/Spec Enforcement in Sage.md`
- `[[SPEC-MAPPING-CAT]]`
- `[[SPEC-MAPPING-SETS]]`
- `[[SPEC-MAPPING-MODULES]]`
- `[[SPEC-MODULE-ROOT-METHOD-OWNERSHIP-MAPPING]]`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The three child tasks are executable without choosing new feature scope.
- [ ] The child task dependency order is linear and blocks broad validation until the
  typed report kernel and witness layer exist.
- [ ] Every child task rejects broad category expansion, full-suite QC cleanup, or local
  obligation duplication as success evidence.

## Dependencies And Boundaries

Task order is part of the phase contract. Do not run the validation task before the
kernel and module witness tasks have produced inspectable artifacts.

## Work Log

- Created with the pivot plan to keep implementation work atomic and reviewable.
- Activated for the spec-core registry/report kernel implementation leaf.
