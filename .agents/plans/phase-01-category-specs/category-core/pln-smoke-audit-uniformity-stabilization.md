# Smoke audit and uniformity stabilization

## Objective

Group smoke-frontier, audit, variadic-signature, import hygiene, wrapper, type, and anti-slop compliance work so it supports the foundational plan instead of becoming a disconnected cleanup backlog.


## Definition Grounding Requirements

This category-core plan coordinates spec work; it does not authorize definitions by
itself. Each child card must ground any category, axiom, Hom/End/Aut surface,
constructor, method, predicate, type alias, or mapping decision before spec edits.

Required sources include the relevant `category_specs/*/docs/MAPPING.md`,
`category_specs/*/docs/SAGE_INVENTORY.md`, Sage written docs/source, local category-spec
skills, and `theory/references/index.md` when a standard mathematical claim is involved.
The card must record exact definition, owner category, hypotheses, codomain/return
object, and proof obligations for equivalence or Sage translation.

## Source corpus

- `plans/LATTICE_STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- `plans/lattice_redesign_corrections_spec.md`
- `/home/dzack/ai/quality-control/vulture_whitelist.py`
- Existing smoke and variadic sprint plans under `.agents/plans/`.
- Existing implementation cards under `.agents/tasks/implementation/`.

## Priority rule

Audit work is critical when it prevents downstream poisoning: wrong definitions, wrong method ownership, stale docs, broad variadic surfaces, fake wrappers, or public APIs that make future work implement the wrong mathematics. Routine formatting and presentation cleanup is not critical.

## Subplans

- `SPR-VARIADIC-AUDIT-01KQN9`: variadic signature closure across modules, rings, tensors, algebras, lattices, posets, sets, and RealSet constructors.

Leaf task ownership is encoded by each card's `planId`; this parent plan should not
own executable cards directly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Smoke failures are routed to spec, implementation, research, or decision cards by mathematical cause.
- [ ] Audit cards link to the plan or source map whose correctness they protect.
- [ ] `/home/dzack/ai/quality-control/vulture_whitelist.py` remains global QC tooling support, not a planning document.
- [ ] Compliance findings are not buried in chat or loose TODO files.
