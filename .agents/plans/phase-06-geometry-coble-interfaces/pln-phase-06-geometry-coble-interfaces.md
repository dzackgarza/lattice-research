# Phase 06 geometry and Coble interfaces

## Objective

Expose semantic interfaces for schemes, varieties, complex varieties, curves, surfaces,
families, divisors, Picard groups, blowups, covers, and Coble-specific relative
constructions.

## Lean and Aristotle thread

Extend the formalization vocabulary only where the geometry interfaces have stabilized.
Targets should be small statements that support later paper arguments: Picard/divisor
vocabulary, pullback and pushforward identities, cover and ramification hypotheses, and
source-backed lemmas that are cleanly expressible without encoding implementation
details.

Aristotle may run asynchronously on these bounded formalization tasks. Do not use it to
skip source acquisition, mathematical review, or the requirement that the repo's
semantic objects state the result clearly.

## Entry criteria

- [ ] Lattice and universal category surfaces are stable enough to express Picard and cover constructions.
- [ ] Backend routing is documented for commutative algebra and algebraic geometry systems.

## Exit criteria

- [ ] Coble constructions can be expressed through Picard, divisor, blowup, cover, pullback, pushforward, and ramification vocabulary.
- [ ] Known primary-source examples are recovered semantically.
- [ ] Geometry-facing formalization cards exist for small reusable lemmas that later Coble proofs will need.
- [ ] QC gates the committed implementation surface before phase transition.
