# Phase 05 lattice-theoretic implementation

## Objective

Build the genuinely lattice-theoretic layer once universal category boilerplate is in
place: discriminant forms, primitive embeddings, local invariants, orthogonal groups,
base change, and Nikulin-style criteria expressed semantically.

## Lean and Aristotle thread

Start formalizing small lattice definitions and lemmas once the corresponding semantic
interfaces are stable. Targets should be local and library-building: basic statements
about forms, discriminant groups, primitive embeddings, base change, and hypotheses used
by Nikulin-style criteria. Do not attempt a major Coble theorem here.

Aristotle may be run asynchronously for bounded Lean tasks, but the accepted artifact is
checked Lean code plus a reviewed link to the source-backed mathematical statement.

## Entry criteria

- [ ] Phase 03 and Phase 04 provide the module, form, Hom/End/Aut, and enumeration surfaces needed by lattices.
- [ ] Backend routing is documented for Oscar, Indefinite.jl, CARAT, GAP, Sage, and related systems.

## Exit criteria

- [ ] Lattice results are expressed through typed lattice objects and morphisms.
- [ ] Primary-source lattice criteria are implemented or wired with traceable evidence.
- [ ] Small lattice lemmas suitable for later Coble arguments have Lean statements or tracked formalization cards.
- [ ] QC gates the committed implementation surface before phase transition.
