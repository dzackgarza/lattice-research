# GAP Technical Issue Update (2026-03-31)

## Problem Statement

Task3_2 orbit computation for O(q_T) acting on 15 primitive isotropic plane images in discriminant group A_T has failed via multiple approaches.

## Attempts

1. **Foundation library approach** (2026-03-30): enumerate_isotropic_planes hangs during enumeration
2. **Direct GAP computation** (2026-03-30, 4 attempts): GAP returns empty string
3. **Prover subagent delegation** (2026-03-30): Empty result
4. **Sage native approach** (2026-03-31): Timeout after 60s

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is not specific to GAP but appears to be computational complexity:
- Discriminant group A_T ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)^11 has order 2048
- Orthogonal group O(q_T) is large
- Orbit computation requires group action on 2048 elements

Both GAP and Sage native methods fail, suggesting the computation is genuinely hard for this size.

## Mathematical Status

- **Enumeration**: COMPLETE - 27 isotropic planes found, 15 primitive
- **J⊥/J verification**: COMPLETE - J⊥/J ≅ A₁^⊕7 confirmed for all 15 planes
- **Orbit uniqueness**: CONJECTURE - supported by Nikulin Prop 1.5.2 (surjectivity O(T) → O(q_T)) but not computationally verified

## Literature Support

Pieroni (2026) Theorem 46 guarantees any isotropic sequence of length ≤8 extends to length 10, providing theoretical support for the uniqueness conjecture.

## Recommendation

Accept orbit uniqueness as CONJECTURE with strong theoretical support rather than continuing to iterate on blocked computational verification.
