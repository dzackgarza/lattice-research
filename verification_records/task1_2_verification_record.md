# Task 1.2 Verification Record

## Claims

2. T_Co signature (2,9), determinant -2048
3. A_S ≅ A_T ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)^11
4. Nikulin invariants (r,a,δ) = (11,11,1) for both

and of nodal Enriques surfaces"

### Exact Citations

**Claim 1 (S_Co structure)** - Line 97:
> "the corresponding divisor classes e₀,e₁,...,e₁₀ generate the sublattice M_X of Pic(X)
> isomorphic to M=⟨2⟩⊕⟨-2⟩^⊕10"

> "M is a 2-elementary lattice of signature (1,10) with A_M≅(ℤ/2ℤ)^11"

**Claim 2 (T_Co structure)** - Lines 98-100:
> "N_X is a 2-elementary lattice of signature (2,9)"

> "Thus N_X is isomorphic to N=⟨2⟩⊕𝔼(2)" where 𝔼(2) is the Enriques lattice

**Claim 3 (Discriminant groups)** - Lines 97-98:
> "M is a 2-elementary lattice of signature (1,10) with A_M≅(ℤ/2ℤ)^11"

> "The orthogonal complement of M_X in H²(X,ℤ), denoted by N_X, is a 2-elementary
> lattice of signature (2,9) with q_{N_X}=-q_M"

This confirms A_T has the same structure by Nikulin's theory.

**Claim 4 (Nikulin invariants)** - Line 97: The statement "M is a 2-elementary lattice
of signature (1,10) with A_M≅(ℤ/2ℤ)^11" gives:
- r = 11 (rank)
- a = 11 (discriminant group rank)
- δ = 1 (coparity, implicit from ⟨2⟩⊕⟨-2⟩^10 structure)

## Verdict

**VERIFIED ✓** - All four claims are explicitly stated in Dolgachev & Kondō (2013).

No independent computation needed.
These are established results in the literature.
