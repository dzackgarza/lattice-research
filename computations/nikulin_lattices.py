"""
Compute Nikulin's 75 lattices from (r,a,δ) triples.

For each triple (r, a, δ), we construct a 2-elementary hyperbolic lattice
with signature (r-1, 1) and discriminant form of length a and parity δ.

Construction method:
1. Start with an even lattice L_even from root lattices + U
2. Use the discriminant group gluing technique
3. Verify: 2-elementary, hyperbolic (signature), and correct discriminant form
