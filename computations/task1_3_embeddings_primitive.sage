Task 1.3 (Primitive): Construct Primitive Embedding S_Co ↪ Λ_K3

This script constructs an EXPLICIT PRIMITIVE embedding of the Coble Picard lattice
S_Co into the K3 lattice Λ_K3, ensuring that S_Co ⊕ T_Co has index 1 in Λ_K3.

Mathematical Problem:
- S_Co = ⟨2⟩ ⊕ ⟨-2⟩¹⁰ (rank 11, signature (1,10), det = 2048)
- Λ_K3 = U³ ⊕ E₈(-1)² (rank 22, signature (3,19), unimodular)
- Need: primitive embedding S_Co ↪ Λ_K3 such that S_Co ⊕ S_Co^⊥ = Λ_K3

Key Issue with Previous Attempts:
- Using E₈ simple roots α_0, α_2, α_4, α_6 doesn't give 4 orthogonal vectors
- The E₈ Dynkin diagram has edges: 0-1-2-3-4-5-7 with 6 connected to 4
- So α_0 ⊥ α_2 is FALSE (they're connected through α_1)

Correct Approach:
1. Use U factors for orthogonal vectors (e+f) and (e-f) are orthogonal with norms 2, -2
2. In E₈(-1), construct orthogonal <-2> vectors explicitly (not from simple roots)
3. Verify primitivity via Smith normal form (all diagonal entries = 1)

"""
In E₈(-1), we need to find mutually orthogonal vectors of norm -2.

The maximum number of mutually orthogonal <-2> vectors in E₈ is 4.
This corresponds to a D₄ sublattice.

Strategy: Use the fact that E₈ contains D₈, and D₈ contains D₄ × D₄.
We can construct orthogonal vectors explicitly.

E₈ can be constructed as:
  E₈ = D₈ ∪ (D₈ + (1/2, 1/2, ..., 1/2))
  
where D₈ = {(x₁, ..., x₈) ∈ ℤ⁸ : Σxᵢ is even}

In the D₈ realization, orthogonal <-2> vectors are easy:
  v₁ = (1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)  (norm -2 in E₈(-1))
  v₂ = (0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
  v₃ = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0)
  v₄ = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1)

But we need to convert from the D₈ basis to the simple root basis.

Alternative: Use SageMath's root lattice functionality to find orthogonal roots.

Strategy for primitive embedding:

Λ_K3 = U₀ ⊕ U₁ ⊕ U₂ ⊕ E₈ₐ(-1) ⊕ E₈ᵦ(-1)

Orthogonal vectors available:
- From each U: (e+f) with norm 2, (e-f) with norm -2

- From E₈(-1): Need mutually orthogonal <-2> vectors
  Maximum in E₈ is 4 (D₄ subsystem)

So we can get:

- U₁: 1 vector of norm 2, 1 vector of norm -2 (total: 2 vectors)  
- U₂: 1 vector of norm 2, 1 vector of norm -2 (total: 2 vectors)
- E₈ₐ(-1): 4 vectors of norm -2 (D₄ subsystem)
- E₈ᵦ(-1): 4 vectors of norm -2 (D₄ subsystem)

Total: 3 vectors of norm 2, 10 vectors of norm -2 = 13 orthogonal vectors

For S_Co (1×⟨2⟩ + 10×⟨-2⟩), we use:
- 1 vector of norm 2 from U₀
- 10 vectors of norm -2: 2 from U's, 4 from E₈ₐ, 4 from E₈ᵦ

This gives us 11 orthogonal vectors spanning S_Co.
