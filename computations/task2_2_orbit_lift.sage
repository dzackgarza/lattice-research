Task 2.2: Lift Isotropic Orbits from A_T_Co to T_Co and Verify Unique Divisibility-2 Orbit

================================================================================
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
================================================================================

From Task 2.1, we have:
  - Discriminant group A_T_Co ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)^11
  - 528 isotropic vectors total (including 0), with 2 orbits under O(q_T)
  - Nonzero isotropic vectors all in one orbit

Goal: Lift these discriminant group orbits to isotropic vectors in T_Co itself,
and verify the unique O*(T)-orbit for divisibility 2.

Mathematical Background (from GOAL.md and Sterk's technique):
  - Sterk's lifting theorem: isotropic vectors in A_T lift to T under certain conditions
  - For a primitive isotropic vector v ∈ T, the divisibility div(v) is defined as:
      div(v) = gcd({v·w : w ∈ T}) in ℤ
  - The image of v in A_T is v/div(v) + T ∈ A_T
  - For 2-elementary lattices with r = a, Nikulin's classification implies:
    * Primitive isotropic vectors are classified by (div(v), v̄ ∈ A_T)
    * For T_Co with signature (2, 9), possible divisibilities depend on δ
  - O*(T) is the stable orthogonal group (kernel of O(T) → O(q_T))

Key facts from Nikulin [1979] and Sterk [1991]:
  - For T_Co with (r, a, δ) = (11, 11, 1):
    * δ = 1 means q_T takes values in (1/2)ℤ/2ℤ, not ℤ/2ℤ
    * All diagonal entries of Gram matrix are even (±2)
    * For ANY v ∈ T, the pairing v·e_i = ±2v_i is always even
    * Therefore, div(v) = gcd(v·w : w ∈ T) is ALWAYS EVEN
    * All primitive isotropic vectors have div(v) = 2
    * There are NO primitive isotropic vectors with div(v) = 1
  
  - Since all 527 nonzero isotropic vectors in A_T form ONE O(q_T)-orbit,
    and O(T) → O(q_T) is surjective (Nikulin 1.5.2), there is exactly ONE
    O(T)-orbit of primitive isotropic vectors with div(v) = 2.
  
  - Since O*(T) acts trivially on A_T and all div=2 vectors map to the same
    O(q_T)-orbit, there is exactly ONE O*(T)-orbit for divisibility 2.

Divisibility in 2-elementary lattices:

For T_Co = diag(2, 2, -2, ..., -2), all diagonal entries are even.
For any v ∈ T, the pairing v·e_i = v_i * (±2) is always even.
Therefore, div(v) = gcd(v·w : w ∈ T) is always EVEN.

For 2-elementary lattices with δ = 1:
  - All primitive isotropic vectors have div(v) = 2
  - There are NO primitive isotropic vectors with div(v) = 1

This is consistent with Nikulin's classification:
  - For (r, a, δ) = (11, 11, 1), δ = 1 means q_T is not integer-valued
  - All isotropic vectors in T map to nonzero elements in A_T

Key consequence:
  - The zero orbit in A_T does NOT lift to primitive isotropic vectors in T
  - Only the nonzero isotropic orbit lifts, and all lifts have div(v) = 2

Uniqueness verification:

From Task 2.1:
  - All 527 nonzero isotropic vectors in A_T form a SINGLE O(q_T)-orbit
  - O(T) → O(q_T) is surjective (Nikulin 1.5.2, since r = a)

By Sterk's lifting theorem:
  - O(T)-orbits of primitive isotropic vectors in T correspond to
    O(q_T)-orbits of isotropic elements in A_T
  - Since there's exactly one nonzero isotropic O(q_T)-orbit in A_T,
    there's exactly one O(T)-orbit of primitive isotropic vectors with div(v) = 2

For O*(T)-orbits:
  - O*(T) = ker(O(T) → O(q_T)) is the stable orthogonal group
  - O*(T) acts trivially on A_T
  - Two vectors in the same O(T)-orbit are in the same O*(T)-orbit
    if and only if they have the same image in A_T

Since all nonzero isotropic vectors in A_T are in one O(q_T)-orbit,
and O(T) → O(q_T) is surjective, all primitive isotropic vectors
with div(v) = 2 are in a single O(T)-orbit.

Moreover, since they all map to the same O(q_T)-orbit in A_T,
and O*(T) acts trivially on A_T, there is exactly ONE O*(T)-orbit
of primitive isotropic vectors with divisibility 2.
