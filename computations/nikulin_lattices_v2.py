r"""
Compute Nikulin's 75 lattices from (r,a,δ) triples.

This script constructs each 2-elementary hyperbolic lattice using the
discriminant group gluing method based on Nikulin's classification.

For each (r, a, δ) with signature (r-1, 1), we build:
- Even part L of signature (r-1, 0) - from root lattices (A_n, D_n, E_n) or E8
- Discriminant group A_L = (Z/2Z)^a with parity δ
- The gluing to get signature (r-1, 1) uses the hyperbolic plane U
